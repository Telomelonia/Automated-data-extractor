IntroductionThe joining stainless steel (SS) titanium (Ti) alloy lead many technological benefit cryogenic, petrochemical, spacecraft, medical, chemical, microelectronics, nuclear, aeronautics industry (Ref 1,2,3). Direct joining SS Ti alloy suffers two major problems. brittle intermetallic compound (IMC) formation joint, TiFe2 TiCr2, first problem due low solubility Fe Ti. second problem occurrence residual stress crack due large difference heat conductivity coefficient thermal expansion SS titanium alloy. heat conductivity coefficient 304 SS Ti6Al4V alloy 14.6 6.7 W m−1 K−1, respectively.The thermal stress laser-welded joint 304 SS Ti6Al4V calculated \(\sigma = E \times \alpha \times \Delta T\), α, ΔT, E coefficient thermal expansion (CTE), temperature difference, Young’s modulus, respectively (Ref 4). 304 SS Ti6Al4V alloy, \(\sigma_{{ 3 0 4\,{\text{SS}}}} = E_{{ 3 0 4 \,{\text{S}}}} \times \alpha_{{ 3 0 4\,{\text{SS}}}} \times \Delta T_{{ 3 0 4\,{\text{SS}}}}\) \(\sigma_{\text{Ti6Al4V}} = E_{\text{Ti6Al4V}} \times \alpha_{\text{Ti6Al4V}} \times \Delta T_{\text{Ti6Al4V}}\), respectively. 304 SS Ti6Al4V, assuming temperature difference constant, \(\Delta T_{\text{Ti6Al4V}} = \Delta T_{{ 3 0 4\,{\text{SS}}}} = \Delta T\). Young’s modulus CTE value Ti6Al4V 304 SS \(E_{\text{Ti6Al4V}} = 110\;{\text{GPa}}\) (Ref 4), \(E_{{304\,{\text{SS}}}} = 193\,{\text{GPa}}\) (Ref 5), \(\alpha_{\text{Ti6Al4V}} = 8.7 \times 10^{ - 6} {\raise0.7ex\hbox{$1$} \!\mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {1 K}}\right.\kern-0pt} \!\lower0.7ex\hbox{$K$}}\)(Ref 4), \(\alpha_{{ 3 0 4\,{\text{SS}}}} = 16 \times 10^{ - 6} {\raise0.7ex\hbox{$1$} \!\mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {1 K}}\right.\kern-0pt} \!\lower0.7ex\hbox{$K$}}\) (Ref 5). thermal stress developed 304 SS Ti6Al4V therefore \(\sigma_{{304\,{\text{SS}}}} = 3.088\,\Delta T\) \(\sigma_{\text{Ti6Al4V}} = 0.957\Delta T,{\text{respectively}}\left( {\sigma \;{\text{values}}\;{\text{will}}\;{\text{be}}\;{\text{in}}\;{\text{MPa}}} \right).\) Thus, \(\sigma_{{304\,{\text{SS}}}} = 3.22\sigma_{\text{Ti6Al4V}}\), mean thermal stress occurred 304 SS 3.22 time greater happened Ti6Al4V alloy, without considering phase formation developed interface two sheets.Consequently, key point achieving solid joint stainless steel titanium alloy avoidance brittle IMC formation (Ref 1, 3, 6,7,8,9,10,11). Interlayer engineering various application dissimilar joining. instance, Ni coating used interlayer Yang et al. (Ref 12) laser welding/brazing aluminum alloy steel.To suggest interlayer joining Ti6Al4V 304 SS, element sufficiently high solubility Ti6Al4V SS chosen. experimental investigation indicate application single interlayer two sheet cannot overpower occurrence brittle IMCs Ti-SS joints. Therefore, composite interlayers, including two different layers, needed.Figure 1 present diagram topology illustrate elementary line transition element maximum solubility room temperature according binary alloy phase diagram (Ref 13).Fig. 1Topological diagram element maximum solubility Fe Ti IMCs formedFull size image Tomashchuk et al. (Ref 8) illustrated mechanical resistance joint stainless steel titanium alloy enhanced placing metallic interlayer change interaction property melted zone (MZ). Sahasrabudhe et al. (Ref 7) suggested effective “bond layer” metal nickel, copper, silver, aluminum, magnesium, create intermetallic compound titanium. Another category possibility welding SSs Ti alloy metal fail create IMCs titanium, molybdenum, vanadium, niobium, zirconium, hafnium, tantalum. high price metallic element difficulty weldability SS lead usage easily attainable low-price alloys, nickel copper alloy (Ref 8).Of interlayer indicated above, Cu considered appropriate alternative support need manufacturing industry. Copper adaptable SS create brittle IMCs Ni, Fe, Cr, C (Ref 8, 9, 14). Additionally, copper flexible interlayer deform readily decrease internal stress concentration joining reduce residual stress produced discrepancy linear expansion, discussed Wang et al. (Ref 15).The joining Ti6Al4V austenitic 304 SS conducted diffusion bonding (Ref 16,17,18,19,20), brazing (Ref 21), explosive bonding (Ref 22), roll bonding (Ref 21), electron beam (EB) welding (Ref 7, 23). Laser beam welding utilized welding alloy dissimilar supply considerably localized heat, fast gradient heating cooling, high level weld precision (Ref 1).Wang et al. (Ref 10) found EB-welded 304 SS Ti6Al2Zr2Mo2V alloy joint made pure V-pure Cu composite filler metals, ultimate strength 288 MPa. Cherepanov et al. (Ref 24) joined CP Ti alloy 304 SS laser welding using pure 0.1-mm-thick Ta pure 1-mm-thick Cu composite layer, obtained weldment ultimate strength 417 MPa. Li et al. (Ref 25) found ultimate strength 300 MPa possible using diffusion-bonded CP Ti alloy 321 SS composite interlayer Nb-Cu-Ni Nb Ni positioned close Ti SS, respectively. thickness Nb, Cu, Ni interlayer 0.01 mm. Lee et al. (Ref 26) produced CP Ti-super SS diffusion-bonded joint high tensile strength use interlayer V-Cr-Ni.Although laser beam welding using Cu sheet interlayer proved interesting welding titanium alloy stainless steel, previous work paid attention laser welding SS Ti alloy Cu-V composite interlayers, especially Ti6Al4V alloy used important material among Ti alloys. article aim increase tensile strength dissimilar Ti6Al4V alloy 304 SS using Cu-V Cu-Ni composite interlayers. article also aim determine joint characterization using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) x-ray diffraction (XRD) methods. joint strength Ti-SS examined different composite interlayers, influence different thickness interlayer composite layer investigated produce maximum tensile strength joint.Experimental ProceduresMaterials employed present paper 2-mm-thick sheet AISI 304 SS (70.15 at.% Fe, 18.28 at.% Cr 8.05 at.% Ni), α-β Ti6Al4V alloy (87.6 at.% Ti, 8.8 at.% Al 3.6 at.% V), 0.5-mm- 1-mm-thick intermediate layer Cu 99.9 at.% purity, 0.5-mm-thick 99.9 at.% pure vanadium pure nickel. size sheet used 200*100*2 mm3. 10 kW laser welding machine (i.e., IPG 10000) welding head focal distance 300 mm, wavelength 1070 nm, focal beam diameter 0.6 mm applied direct laser onto samples. First, rough emery cloth used polish sheet metal ensure welding surface smooth. Next, acetone used remove external particle joining surface pairing materials, well interlayers. interlayer sheet fastened SS edge laser pulse along direction joint. Then, stainless steel Ti6Al4V sheet were, butt-weld geometry, pressed together kept position mechanically fixing stop misalignment thermal expansion. optical system inclined 5° vertical axis prevent damage fiber end reflected light. additional device provide protective gas concealed bottom top molten pool reduce rise plasma suppression oxidation may cause brittleness joint. shielding gas used argon, total flow 10 L min−1 bottom 20 L min−1 top joint coaxial nozzle 8 mm diameter.The welding rate laser power chosen 2 min−1 3.5 kW, respectively. Using wire electrical discharge machines, welded specimen sliced small specimen tensile experiment. analysis specimen performed scanning electron microscope fast EDS analyzers. fracture surface phase recognized XRD CuKα radiation scan rate 1 (°) min−1 angle range (2θ) 30° 90°. Then, Jade software standard PDF card used determine phases.Test sample EBSD prepared utilizing normal vibration mechanical polishing. EBSD system (i.e., AZtec Nordlys Max3) used acquire data step size 0.2-2 µm 20 kV accelerating voltage. data analyzed using software (i.e., HKL Technologies Channel 5) determine reconstruction pole figure texture, well study misorientation grain boundary. measure tensile properties, tensile sample machined gauge width 3 mm, gauge length 16 mm, gauge thickness 2 mm. joints’ tensile strength analyzed using universal tensile experiment machine (i.e., Zwick Z100) 1 mm min−1 tensile speed room temperature. result final tensile testing recorded determined average six specimen weld. microindentation measurement using Vickers performed 15-s load time 100-mN load.To investigate thermodynamics assessment compound occurred MZ, thermodynamics software used TCFE08 ThermoCalc (Ref 27), Pandat™ version (2016) (Ref 28) JMatPro Version 6.1, developed Sente Software Corporation databases. fiber laser system used investigation shown Fig. 2.Fig. 2Schematic diagram (a) (b) single composite interlayer structures, respectively, based 0.5-mm-thick Cu; (c), (d), (e) single, Ni-Cu1, Cu1-V composite interlayer structure set based 1-mm-thick Cu dissimilar Ti-SS laser welding 3.5 kWFull size image increase joint strength laser beam-welded Ti-Cu-Fe joints, investigation conducted 0.5- 1-mm-thick Cu. Meanwhile, composite interlayers, including Cu-V Ni-Cu, examined. clear vanadium interlayer positioned next Ti alloy copper interlayer positioned next SS. Vanadium 100% solubility iron, chromium, titanium 40% solubility nickel (Ref 2) melting temperature close Ti (Ref 1); guarantee dangerous IMCs occur Ti-V interface, solubility titanium copper le vanadium (Ref 13). solubility V Cu together great (Ref 13), also create brittle IMCs solidification.Furthermore, Wang et al. (Ref 10) noted expansion coefficient ratio Ti6Al4V pure V pure Cu 304 SS 8.7:8.3 16.9:16.0, respectively, mean thermal stress cracking developed welding interface Ti6Al4V-V Cu-304 SS. Therefore, Cu-V composite interlayer form chosen appropriate choice laser welding titanium alloy stainless steel. clear Ni interlayer positioned next SS SS/Ni-Cu1/Ti setup, according shallow solubility Ti Ni (Ref 29). Meanwhile, Ni 100% solubility Cu.The laser radiation focused Cu center sample based 0.5-mm-thick Cu, shown Fig. 2(a) (b), laser beam focused Cu-SS, Ni-Cu, Cu-V interface SS/Cu1/Ti, SS/Ni-Cu1/Ti, SS/Cu1-V/Ti joints, respectively, illustrated Fig. 2(c), (d), (e), hinder high melting Ti alloy.Results DiscussionThe Joints’ Structures Mechanical PropertiesThe cross-sectional macrostructures joint made Cu, Cu-V, Ni-Cu interlayer structure shown Fig. 3. Figure 3 depicts joint defect-free naked eye.Fig. 3Macrostructures joint cross section (a) SS/Cu/Ti (b) SS/Cu-V/Ti joint based 0.5-mm-thick Cu; (c) SS/Cu1/Ti, (d) SS/Ni-Cu1/Ti, (e) SS/Cu1-V/Ti jointsFull size image evaluate mechanical property cross section joints, microhardness result depicted Fig. 4(a) (c). maximum hardness value occurred Ti-side MZ single interlayer sample based 0.5-mm-thick Cu, well sample based 1-mm-thick Cu, due brittle IMC formation. reason increase hardness difference thermal conduction coefficient SS Ti. thermal conduction coefficient Ti6Al4V roughly half 304 SS (Ref 11), Ti-MZ interface lower cooling rate. Consequently, diffusion time Ti-MZ interface longer SS-MZ interface; lead Ti-MZ interface becoming sensitive formation brittle IMCs.Fig. 4Comparison (a) microhardness distribution profile (b) stress–strain plot SS/Cu/Ti SS/Cu-V/Ti joint based 0.5-mm-thick Cu; (c) microhardness profile (d) stress–strain plot SS/Cu1/Ti, SS/Ni-Cu1/Ti, SS/Cu1-V/Ti jointsFull size image Fe Ti atom easily meet form brittle IMCs within MZ single interlayer sample based 0.5-mm-thick Cu, formation brittle IMCs seems made difficult adding excess V interlayer composite interlayer joint based 0.5-mm-thick Cu. XRD result Fig. 5 prove large difference hardness value single composite interlayer joint due formation brittle Fe2Ti Ti-side MZ single interlayer sample lack composite interlayer sample. Meanwhile, EBSD result Fig. 7 8 illustrate Fe2Ti CuTi occurred fracture propagation edge single composite interlayer samples, respectively.Fig. 5XRD analysis fracture surface joint welded (a) single Cu (b) composite Cu-V interlayer structure based 0.5-mm-thick Cu; (c) single Cu, (d) Ni-Cu, (e) Cu-V composite interlayer structure based 1-mm-thick Cu welded 3.5 kWFull size image According Fig. 4(c), sample joined 1-mm-thick single Cu interlayer brittle joint, Cu1-V composite interlayer sample ductile. difference hardness value single composite interlayer sample Fig. 4(a) close Fig. 4(c) formation Fe2Ti compound brittle IMCs system Fe-Ti-Cu within SS/Cu0.5/Ti sample, rest samples, Fe-Ti IMCs detected.As Fig. 4(b) illustrates, tensile strength elongation SS/Cu-V/Ti joint 32 61% higher SS/Cu/Ti joint, respectively. Fig. 4(d) illustrates, tensile strength elongation SS/Cu1-V/Ti joint 49 317% greater SS/Cu1/Ti joint, respectively. strength SS/Cu1-V/Ti joint laser power 3.5 kW ranged 343.5 MPa, 56% ultimate strength detailed Gao et al. (Ref 6) laser welding previously investigated pairing materials.Although joint strength composite interlayer structure higher single interlayer structures, joint strength composite interlayer sample based 0.5-mm-thick Cu high enough requires use composite interlayer structure higher thickness Cu base interlayer based comparison Fig. 4(b) (d).The strength elongation SS/Cu1/Ti sample 1.8 time 2.7 time higher SS/Cu0.5/Ti sample based comparison shown Fig. 4(b) (d). result due higher thickness Cu also focusing laser beam away Ti alloy compared SS/Cu0.5/Ti sample. mentioned reason caused mixing Fe Ti atom occur easily SS/Cu0.5/Ti sample SS/Cu1/Ti sample, formation brittle Fe2Ti occurred easily SS/Cu0.5/Ti sample.According Fig. 4(b) (d), joint strength elongation SS/Cu1-V/Ti structure 2 7 time greater SS/Cu0.5-V/Ti structure, respectively. large difference due focal position laser beam SS/Cu1-V/Ti sample compared SS/Cu0.5-V/Ti sample. composite samples, brittle Fe-Ti IMCs detected, shown Fig. 5(b) (e) use excess V interlayer. Although laser beam focusing SS/Cu1-V/Ti structure closer Ti alloy compared SS/Cu0.5-V/Ti, usage V interlayer prohibited mixing Ti Fe atoms. closer distance laser beam Ti alloy SS/Cu1-V/Ti sample compared SS/Cu0.5-V/Ti sample caused titanium atom migrate toward Cu interlayer SS/Cu1-V/Ti sample compared SS/Cu0.5-V/Ti sample, softer IMCs, CuTi2, occurred within SS/Cu1-V/Ti weldment, brittle IMCs, CuTi, happened within SS/Cu0.5-V/Ti weldment due lower migration Ti atom toward Cu interlayer SS/Cu0.5-V/Ti sample.Fracture CharacterizationAfter tensile testing, fracture side including Ti alloy recognized Ti-side, side involving copper 304 SS recognized SS-side. joined specimen fractured Ti-side MZ completion tensile testing. Figure 5 show XRD analysis conducted fracture surface Ti-side joint welded single Cu composite interlayer structures. several phase formed fracture surface specimens, volume percent phase low.Although Fig. 5(a) show fracture surface SS/Cu/Ti joint contains weak peak αTi, also includes brittle IMCs, Fe2Ti Cr2Ti. Meanwhile, Cu-Ti IMCs, well Al-IMCs, detected sample. However, fracture surface sample made composite interlayer contains CuTi, Mn2Ti, Al-IMCs. shown Fig. 5(b), Fe-Ti IMCs Cr2Ti observed XRD result. reason low interlayer thickness, result convection movement Fe atom toward Ti increasing reach solubility limit Ti, Fe2Ti phase start occur due binary Fe-Ti phase diagram.Wang et al. (Ref 10) obtained melting degree vanadium (2175 K) approximately 800 °C greater copper (1358 K), Cu’s thermal conductivity approximately 13 time higher V. Therefore, heat conduction migration SS element SS-side toward Ti-side MZ single interlayer sample faster composite interlayer sample.Because element binary system Fe-Cr solid state high temperature soluble other, iron atom displaced chromium atom (Ref 9) IMC lattice, Cr2Ti occur along Fe2Ti single Cu interlayer sample. Arita et al. (Ref 30) stated Fe2Ti Cr2Ti defined brittle IMCs may created ternary system SS-Cu-Ti system. Therefore, brittleness single interlayer joint composite interlayer sample based 0.5-mm-thick Cu. Figure 6 plot Gibbs free energy versus temperature curve major phase detected Fig. 5, formed fracture surface sample welded various conditions.Fig. 6Comparison Gibbs free energy temperature different phase formed fracture surface sample based 0.5-mm-thick Cu: (a) CuTi, Fe2Ti, αTi, (b) Cr2Ti Fe2Ti; (c) sample based 1-mm-thick Cu [Fe2Ti Thermo Calc database (Ref 27); CuTi CuTi2 (Ref 30); αTi (Ref 31), Cr2Ti (Ref 32); Cu3Ti2 (Ref 33); Al8V5 (Ref 28); Cu4Ti3 (Ref 34); (Cu), (Fe), NiTi (Ref 35); NiTi2 (Ref 31)]Full size image According Fig. 6(a) (b), temperatures:$$\Delta G_{{{\text{Cr}}_{ 2} {\text{Ti}}}}^{{^\circ }} \ll \Delta G_{{{\text{Fe}}_{ 2} {\text{Ti}}}}^{{^\circ }} < \Delta G_{{\alpha {\text{Ti}}}}^{{^\circ }}$$ (1) Equation 1 mean Cr Fe atom exist Ti-MZ interface, first Cr2Ti occur, Fe2Ti, αTi, CuTi formed. iron chromium atom consumed Fe2Ti Cr2Ti formation, remaining Ti reacted Cu Cu-Ti IMCs Cu4Ti3 CuTi occur single interlayer sample. αTi may created interdendritic region Cu-Ti Fe-Ti IMCs. αTi became stable due rejection excess element solidifying Ti-Cu Fe-Ti liquid alloy according low solubility solid state dendrite toward liquid positioned interdendritic regions.When Fe Cr migrated SS toward Ti-side MZ composite interlayer sample, dissolved beyond solubility limit Ti. Fe Cr formed αTi solid solution due lower temperature Ti-side melted zone compared single interlayer sample high solubility Fe Cr Ti (Ref 13). Hence, Fe-Ti IMCs Cr2Ti detected XRD result composite interlayer sample based 0.5-mm-thick Cu, indicates atomic diffusion migration stainless steel titanium alloy element effectively stopped excess V interlayer.Figure 5(c) show fracture surface SS/Cu1/Ti joint contains αTi, Al8V5 Cu-Ti IMCs. addition, NiTi2, investigated Seretsky et al. (Ref 29) brittle compound, detected fracture surface sample. Meanwhile, weak peak (Cu) solid solution compound observed Fig. 5(c). fracture surface SS/Ni-Cu1/Ti joint shown Fig. 5(d) contains αTi solid solution CuTi2, NiTi2, Al8V5. XRD analysis result fracture surface SS/Cu1-V/Ti joint (Fig. 5e) confirmed contains (Cu), αTi, (Fe) solid solution (Cu) αTi stronger peak (Fe) compound. Furthermore, fracture surface composite interlayer sample contains Cu-Ti IMCs. Meanwhile, NiTi recognized ductile compound formed SS/Cu1-V/Ti fracture surface (Ref 29).Al-IMCs created fracture surface specimen due high solubility Al copper compared solubility Ti copper (Ref 13). Moreover, high likelihood Al reacting elements, vanadium, well significant thermal gradient Ti alloy-MZ interface MZ. mentioned reason motivated Ti atom migrate toward MZ. added Al-IMCs content low fracture surface compound could detected EDS fracture edge Fig. 11.Whereas, Fe-Ti IMCs Cr2Ti detected XRD result either composite interlayer single interlayer sample based 1-mm-thick Cu, Fe Cr migrated SS toward Ti-side MZ sample dissolved solubility limit Ti. formed αTi solid solution according large solubility Fe Cr atom titanium. Furthermore laser focus position close SS composite interlayer samples, large migration SS toward Ti alloy.According XRD result Fig. 5(c), (d), (e), strength SS/Ni-Cu1/Ti sample higher SS/Cu1/Ti sample due lack CuTi brittle IMC, stated Zhang et al. (Ref 36). Furthermore, tensile strength SS/Cu1-V/Ti joint SS/Ni-Cu1/Ti joint due formation ductile NiTi instead brittle NiTi2.The thermal conductivity nickel, vanadium, copper 91, 35, 401 W m−1 K−1, respectively. According values, heat conduction path across interlayer shown Fig. 7 interlayer structures. figure illustrates, strongest heat conduction happened across single interlayer sample shown Fig. 7(a) sample made single Cu interlayer, heat conducted across V interlayer Fig. 7(c) minimum, shown low-thickness arrow. Heat conduction Ni interlayer Fig. 7(b) le Cu interlayer figure V interlayer Fig. 7(c). Meanwhile, heat conducted single Cu interlayer Cu interlayer composite interlayer structures. Hence, Ti-MZ interface:$$T_{{{\text{Cu}}1 - {\text{V}}}} < T_{{{\text{Ni}} - {\text{Cu}}1}} < T_{\text{Cu1}}$$ (2) SS-MZ interface samples:$$T_{{{\text{Ni}} - {\text{Cu}}1}} < T_{{{\text{Cu}}1 - {\text{V}}}} < T_{{{\text{Cu}}1}}$$ (3) equal interface temperature.Fig. 7Schematic heat conduction path across (a) single Cu interlayer, (b) Ni-Cu interlayer, (c) Cu-V interlayer based 1-mm-thick CuFull size image interface temperature Ti-MZ single Cu interlayer sample maximum, Ti atom participated formation Ni-Ti IMCs, NiTi2 developed sample.According Eq 2 3, Ti-MZ interface temperature SS/Ni-Cu1/Ti sample higher SS/Cu1-V/Ti sample, SS-MZ interface temperature SS/Ni-Cu1/Ti sample lower SS/Cu1-V/Ti sample, mean Ti atom participated formation Ni-Ti IMCs SS/Ni-Cu1/Ti sample compared SS/Cu1-V/Ti sample. Consequently, NiTi2 stable compound fracture surface SS/Ni-Cu1/Ti sample. NiTi developed SS/Cu1-V/Ti interlayer sample due lower Ti-MZ interface temperature.The main parameter caused tensile strength SS/Cu1-V/Ti joint maximum value low temperature Ti-MZ interface compared samples; caused low percentage Ti atom participate Ti-Ni IMCs formation ductile NiTi sample.Figure 6(c) depicts that, SS/Cu1/Ti sample, NiTi2 Al8V5 first formed fracture path due MZ heat. Cu3Ti2 sectioned (Cu) αTi approximately 1050 K, shown Fig. 6(c). Cu3Ti2 created fracture surface SS/Cu1/Ti sample, concluded fracture surface temperature sample welding higher 1050 K. αTi (Cu) compound created accordingly. (Cu) solid solution nucleated dendritic morphology, titanium content around dendrite increases, formation CuTi2 exceeds CuTi. Meanwhile, ΔG° CuTi2 le CuTi. peak (Cu) compound strong, position (Cu) formed, αTi occur. Then, CuTi stable CuTi2 near αTi dendrites.In SS/Ni-Cu1/Ti sample, NiTi2 Al8V5 IMCs first formed along fracture path due low ΔG°. fracture surface temperature sample higher 1050 K, based Fig. 6(c), Cu3Ti2 observed fracture surface sample. Whereas ΔG° αTi le CuTi2 temperature higher 1050 K, αTi first formed, followed development CuTi2 around αTi dendrites, according low solubility Cu Ti.For SS/Cu1-V/Ti sample, NiTi first created along fracture path due minimum ΔG°. Given Cu3Ti2 detected XRD result sample, fracture surface temperature higher approximately 1050 K. Then, (Fe), (Cu), αTi solid solution dendrite formed, albeit content (Fe) minimum among mentioned solid solution compounds.When (Cu) (Fe) dendrite formed sample, Ti atom refuse solidify (Cu) (Fe) liquid alloy low solubility solid solution dendrite diffuse toward liquid positioned interdendritic region (Cu) (Fe) compounds. Consequently, CuTi2 could formed due lower ΔG° Cu4Ti3 (as shown Fig. 6c). position αTi developed, formation Cu4Ti3 exceeded CuTi2 due lower presence Ti next αTi.Edge Characterization FractureTo deeply characterize crack propagation path, EBSD experiment performed crack propagation path weldment tensile experiments. Fig. 8(a) (h) illustrate, SS-side Ti-side fracture edge single interlayer sample contain Fe2Ti. Hence, crack propagation path single interlayer sample based 0.5-mm-thick Cu roughly pass grain boundary Fe2Ti.Fig. 8(a) (h) EBSD map SS-side Ti-side fracture edge zone single interlayer joint based 0.5-mm-thick Cu welded 3.5 kW step size 0.12 µm; (b, i), (c), (j), (k) IPF colored map Fe2Ti (SS-side, Ti-side), αTi (SS-side), FeTi (Ti-side), CuTi (Ti-side) acquired step size 0.12 µm; (d), (e), (f) (g) coloring legend Fe2Ti, αTi, FeTi CuTi, respectively, parallel NDFull size image Meanwhile, crack propagates intergranularly Fe2Ti grain boundary due difference crystal orientation Fe2Ti side fracture line. instance, Fe2Ti SS-side fracture path consists roughly <010> texture component parallel ND; however, texture component Ti-side fracture path mainly comprised <121> .Figure 8(h) also show crack propagated fracture edge toward Ti sheet. obvious side crack texture component <121> parallel ND, mean crack occurred transgranularly Fe2Ti compound. Therefore, transgranular cracking occurred low strength large Fe2Ti grain due Hall–Petch equation (Ref 37, 38), cracking along fracture path sample happened intergranularly.Both SS- Ti-sides composite interlayer joint based 0.5-mm-thick Cu fracture primarily filled CuTi, seen Fig. 9(a) (f). CuTi formed interdendritic region FeTi dendrite also shown Fig. 9(a) (f). Figure 9(b) (g) show texture component parallel ND FeTi stainless steel- Ti-sides crack propagation path same. Hence, crack propagation path composite interlayer sample roughly pass intergranularly grain boundary FeTi. Meanwhile, texture component parallel ND CuTi stainless steel- Ti-sides fracture path roughly same, shown Fig. 9(c) (h). Consequently, crack propagated transgranularly CuTi compound solidified interdendritic region FeTi compounds. Hence, crack arrest property composite interlayer sample higher single interlayer sample.Fig. 9(a) (f) EBSD map SS-side Ti-side fracture edge zone composite interlayer joint based 0.5-mm-thick Cu welded 3.5 kW step size 0.12 µm; (b, g), (c, h) IPF colored map FeTi (SS-side, Ti-side) CuTi (SS-side, Ti-side) acquired step size 0.12 µm; (d), (e) coloring legend map FeTi CuTi, respectively, parallel NDFull size image According Fig. 10, area crack propagation edge SS-side SS/Cu1-V/Ti joint contained Cu3Ti2 consisted mainly <010> texture component parallel ND. However, area crack propagation edge Ti-side SS/Cu1-V/Ti joint contained αTi consisted mainly <010> <001> texture component also Cu4Ti consisted mainly <001> <130> texture component parallel ND. seems distribution density αTi higher Cu4Ti fracture edge Ti-side joint, shown Fig. 10(j) (l). Hence, fracture happened roughly along grain boundary Cu3Ti2 (from SS-side) αTi (from Ti-side) SS/Cu1-V/Ti joint. Meanwhile, observed Fig. 10(b) (j) Cu3Ti2 αTi compound texture component roughly <010>, parallel ND, cause Cu3Ti2/αTi grain boundary considered low-angle grain boundaries; then, resistance crack propagation increases.Fig. 10EBSD map (a) SS-side (h) Ti-side fractured SS/Cu1-V/Ti joint welded 3.5 kW step size 0.12 µm; (b i), (f l), (d) (j) IPF colored map Cu3Ti2 (SS-side, Ti-side), Cu4Ti (SS-side, Ti-side), (Cu) (SS-side) αTi (Ti-side) acquired step size 0.12 µm; (c), (e), (g) (k) coloring legend Cu3Ti2, (Cu), Cu4Ti, αTi parallel ND, respectivelyFull size image microstructures fracture edge tensile testing illustrate eutectic CuTi + CuTi2 SS/Cu1/Ti sample fractured tensile testing, CuTi2 phase fractured tensile experiment SS/Ni-Cu1/Ti sample, shown Fig. 11(a), (d), (b), (e), respectively.

CuTi2 distributed toward SS-side joint, Cu percentage participates type Ti-Cu IMC increased; Cu3Ti2 thus detected EDS. Thus, main phase cracked welding fracture edge SS/Ni-Cu1/Ti sample CuTi2.Figure 12(a), (b), (c) depict mole fraction compound belong Points A, B, C Fig. 11(d), (e), (f), respectively, determined EDS.

According high quench rate, βTi time nucleate grow formation requires diffusion element Ti structure.Fig. 12Simulation result amount phase occur cooling crack propagation edge (a) SS/Cu1/Ti joint containing 0.82% Al, 49.67% Ti, 1.11% V, 1.72% Cr, 0.40% Mn, 12.01% Fe, 0.62% Ni, 36.67% Cu [database ThermoCalc (Ref 27)]; (b) SS/Ni-Cu1/Ti joint containing 0.67% Al, 63.80% Ti, 0.45% V, 0.10% Cr, 0.32% Mn, 1.41% Fe, 0.33% Ni, 33.82% Cu (database JMatPro); (c) SS/Cu1-V/Ti joint containing 0.17% Al, 67.32% Ti, 0.25% V, 0.47% Cr, 0.52% Mn, 0.37% Fe, 12.16% Ni, 20.27% Cu (database JMatPro)Full size image Figure 12(b) illustrates that, solidification MZ, CuTi2 start created temperature approximately 1000 °C, low βTi content begin formation temperature approximately 20 °C lower CuTi2. Hence, existence CuTi2 predominant compound fracture edge SS/Ni-Cu1/Ti joint consistent result Fig. 12(b).Figure 12(c) suggests that, solidification MZ, first CuTi2 βTi start form. obvious comparing Fig. 12(b) (c) mole fraction CuTi2 fracture edge SS/Cu1-V/Ti sample le SS/Ni-Cu1/Ti joint, βTi content SS/Cu1-V/Ti joint higher SS/Ni-Cu1/Ti sample. transformation temperature βTi αTi relatively high cooling speed MZ solidification process fast (Ref 40), βTi transforms αTi. Therefore, existence eutectoid αTi + CuTi2 predominant compound fracture edge SS/Cu1-V/Ti joint consistent result Fig. 12(c). mentioned Fe content fracture edge SS/Cu1/Ti, SS/Ni-Cu1/Ti, SS/Ni-Cu1/Ti sample 12.01, 1.41, 0.37%, respectively. iron content fracture edge composite interlayer sample low, use TCFE08 THERMOCALC database calculation useless; mentioned database used single interlayer joint simulation.ConclusionCommercially, Ti6Al4V successfully laser beam-welded 304 SS using Cu, V, Ni interlayer different single Cu interlayer composite interlayer structure different Cu interlayer thicknesses. following conclusion drawn investigation: 1. Investigations based 0.5-mm-thick Cu interlayer 3.5 kW showed formation highly brittle IMCs, Fe2Ti Cr2Ti, fracture surface single interlayer joint; however, fracture surface composite interlayer sample contained CuTi Mn2Ti, together Al-IMCs. Fe-Ti IMCs Cr2Ti observed XRD result. elongation ultimate strength SS/Cu-V/Ti joint 61 32% higher SS/Cu/Ti joint, respectively. result indicates atomic mixing Fe Ti atom effectively prevented excess 0.5-mm-thick V interlayer. 2. Investigations based 1-mm-thick Cu interlayer 3.5 kW showed strength SS/Ni-Cu1/Ti sample higher SS/Cu1/Ti sample due lack CuTi brittle IMC. Furthermore, according XRD results, tensile strength SS/Cu1-V/Ti joint higher SS/Ni-Cu1/Ti joint due formation ductile NiTi instead brittle NiTi2. tensile strength elongation SS/Cu1-V/Ti weldment laser power 3.5 kW 49 317% greater SS/Cu1/Ti joint, respectively. 3. investigation depicted joint strength composite interlayer structure based 0.5-mm-thick Cu high enough, thus necessitating use higher thickness Cu base interlayer.

Also Fig. 11d show relationship welding technique performance factor penetration depth variation welding current.Fig. 11Effect welding current on: bead width reinforcement height; b reinforcement area penetration area; c penetration depth bead overlap area; welding technique performance factor penetration depthFull size imageFigure 11a–d show weld bead parameters, namely Bw, Rh, Pa, Ra, Pd Oa, generally increased increase welding current 340 390 A. Figure 11a show weld width increase initially, that, reduces slightly, increase current, higher initial weld width. Figure 11b show welding current increases, reinforcement area penetration area gradually increase. welding current crucial process variable submerged arc welding (SAW). amount heat generated welding process directly proportional square welding current. Figure 11c show penetration depth increased linearly increase welding current since welding current pronounced effect depth penetration. According Murugan Gunaraj [22], effect welding explained follows: welding current increase momentum filler metal droplets, impinge weld pool causing deep penetration. Keeping parameter constant increasing welding current enhance penetration, electrode deposition rate, bead width weld cross-sectional area. Also, noticed bead overlap area increase welding current varied 340 390 A, due higher heat generation larger fusion zone size increased welding currents. aspect Fig. 11 need description. welding technique performance factor (WTPF), related penetration depth, shown Fig. 11d. observed increase welding current directly proportional WTPF; hence, follows trend Pd.3.2.2 Effect welding voltageFigure 12a–c depicts effect welding voltage bead width, reinforcement height, reinforcement area, penetration area, penetration depth bead overlap area.

Bimetallic material advantage two metal components, application steel-aluminum composite plate reduce mass SS-304 stainless steel improve corrosion resistance. Explosive welding solid-phase welding method, used welding double-layer multilayer composite plate different metal [1,2,3,4,5,6]. Compared traditional diffusion welding [7,8], light welding [9,10], magnetic pulse welding [11,12], hot rolling welding [13,14], explosive welding method still good welding quality case large difference point mechanical property welded metal, extensively used metal welding. high tensile strength, low price, outstanding corrosion resistance, steel fiber widely used reinforce concrete improve protective performance. paper, explosive welding used produce new fiber-reinforced steel aluminum composite plate combining advantage SS-304 stainless steel, 2A12 aluminum, steel fiber.Extensive study conducted steel-aluminum composite plates, outstanding achievements. 1983, Kotov V studied [15] unidirectional fiber-reinforced composite composed steel wire based Amr6 aluminum alloy, result revealed uniaxial biaxial loads, strength fiber-reinforced composite mostly dependent bonding strength wire base plate, well internal geometric installation, load along wire, effect relatively obvious. Therefore, fiber-reinforced composite tubular product prepared explosive welding sufficient strength various loads. Zhou et al.

Interface Evolution MechanismThe bonding explosive welding divided three categories: (1) direct bonding metals; (2) forming uniform continuous melting layer; (3) undulate bonding, common form. undulate bonding, molten material bonding interface retained vortex periodically discontinuously separated, external load, microcrack source generated interface defect melting tank easily propagated. Therefore, ideal method tiny undulate bonding. Many experiment study shown realize high-quality explosive welding, following three requirement met: (1) undulate bonding obtained certain collision conditions, is, impact velocity vp impact angle β meet explosive welding window; (2) must jet formation welding, interface self-cleaning, exposing fresh surface; (3) fine uniform corrugated interface flat interface sufficient strength formed. Finally, better understand problem, SPH simulation introduced study detailed evolution process steel-aluminum interface.Figure 3a–c show evolution mechanism influence steel fiber jet particles. shown Figure 3a, welding process, incident jet consisted two layer surface. particle ejected flyer plate moved obliquely downwards acted base plate surface, thereby compressing base plate, causing form depression, forming corresponding bulge base plate surface, generating forward jet. incident jet could also remove oxide impurity surface, help establish ideal welding condition circumstance original clean contact [28]. However, detonation explosive, explosive product formed high-voltage pulse load, directly acted flyer plate. Then, flyer plate accelerated reached speed several hundred meters/second microseconds, starting starting end, collided base plate turn, formed certain angle. time, fixed included angle formed flyer plate, steel fiber, base plate prevented jet continuing act surface base plate, large number particle converged side steel fiber, shown Figure 3b. steel fiber spacing 5 mm, jet blocked, new jet continued generate.

Among them, addition steel fiber diameter 0.5 mm produced obvious vortex area cracks, taken example analyze impact addition steel fiber bonding interface composite plate combining numerical simulation. Figure 6 schematic diagram thermodynamic state explosive welding process. shown Figure 6a, jet particle filled unilateral side steel fiber, high-temperature high-pressure environment formed, pressure 10 GPa. three materials, pressure much greater yield strength 235 MPa, steel fiber directly contacting jet particle would behave fluid undergo strong plastic deformation.

Since time enough reduce large-scale heat, molten particle could rapidly solidified. Then, residual velocity forced molten particle one side steel fiber stir mix strongly, finally vortex region crack formed, shown yellow region Figure 7b. Yang, Zhang, Bazarnik et al.

However, cooling rate fast, iron element middle molten region solidified separated, content iron element near bonding interface le middle vortex, also indirectly confirmed research result obtained Zeng [35] Zhang et al.

Among them, sample group 1− 5+ steel-aluminum composite plate without steel fibers. highest lowest tensile resistance property removed two group data, 435.35 MPa 438.93 MPa, respectively. difference tensile resistance two group could neglected, influence propagation direction detonation wave tensile resistance excluded. summary, addition steel fiber could improve tensile resistance steel-aluminum composite plate prepared explosive welding. increase steel fiber diameter, tensile resistance strength increased gradually. Agraw Ryuichi [15] used explosive welding produce fiber composite consisting high-strength plastic steel wire pure aluminum titanium matrix, verified strength composite tensile tests. result revealed optimum tensile resistance load determined volume fiber part, is, larger volume fiber added, stronger tensile resistance. Taking AMr6 aluminum alloy base plate unidirectional fiber composited steel wire reinforced composite material, Kotov V [15] pointed strength material depended internal geometric installation uniaxial biaxial load many cases. load parallel fiber, fiber particularly large effect composite. result revealed fiber-reinforced composite tubular product prepared explosive welding high enough strength various loads. Explosion strengthening using force generated explosive replace mechanical forging strength steel improved certain extent, effect austenitic steel obvious subjected explosion strengthening process. Therefore, steel fiber selected steel fiber-reinforced phase. strengthening metal composite material prepared explosive welding mainly includes two aspects: (1) explosive welding, base plate, composite plate, steel fiber subjected explosion strengthening, tensile strength improved; (2) overall tensile resistance strength composite material explosive welding better base plate metal [48]. addition steel fibers, tensile resistance steel-aluminum composite plate greatly increased. tensile resistance steel fiber parallel tensile load direction much larger perpendicular tensile load direction. Therefore, tensile resistance steel fiber-reinforced steel-aluminum composite plate greatly improved. main reason follows. (1) explosive welding process, tensile resistance steel fiber improved due explosion strengthening. (2) addition steel fiber improved overall tensile resistance steel fiber-reinforced steel-aluminum composite plates. Table 4. Tensile performance parameter steel-aluminum composite plates. 3.5. Fracture Appearance AnalysisSEM used analyze fracture tensile specimen study failure mechanism steel fiber-reinforced steel-aluminum composite plates. Figure 14a show overall morphology fracture tensile specimen. top bottom, layer 2A12 aluminum, S20910 steel fiber SS 304 stainless steel. overall fracture morphology relatively flat, small tough nest quasi-dissociative fracture opening still observed, prof different fracture occurred different materials. Meanwhile, observed steel fiber separated aluminum layer remain bonded steel layer. Figure 14b show fracture morphology 2A12 aluminum layer, observed fracture surface hole-like, hole shallow edge hole parabolic, showing obvious dimple shape. Therefore, fracture 2A12 aluminum layer ductile fracture, worth noting near edge welding line, dimple morphology 2A12 aluminum layer gradually changed, depth hole gradually became shallow. main reason composite plate subjected explosion strengthening explosive welding process, deformation increased, strength explosive strengthening also gradually increased, also verified maximum deformation numerical simulation result occurred bonding interface, shown Figure 6c. microhardness bonding interface 2A12 aluminum steel fiber also greater 2A12 aluminum, confirmed bonding interface subjected explosion strengthening, shown Figure 11. Figure 14c show fracture morphology steel layer high multiples. Obvious tearing edge hole observed, flat cleavage section, steel layer quasi-cleavage fracture. fracture morphology steel fiber shown Figure 14d, seen fracture steel fiber relatively flat, small dimple obvious tearing edge surface, steel fiber also quasi-cleavage fracture. Meanwhile, also observed steel fiber extracted, local section reduced maintaining connection base plate composite plate, judged steel fiber necking phenomenon. steel fiber completely broken fracture behavior plate stretching process, necking phenomenon finally broken stretching.

ConclusionsThe steel fiber-reinforced steel-aluminum composite plate successfully prepared explosive welding, interface evolution mechanism steel-aluminum composite interface adding steel fiber simulated SPH method. Then, steel fiber-reinforced steel-aluminum composite plate studied using SEM, EDS, tensile tests, following conclusion drawn.(1)The SPH simulation method proved certain angle formed steel fiber, base plate, composite plate, blocked direction jet jet accumulated one side steel fiber form environment high temperature, high pressure, high strain rate, thereby forming vortex area. residual stress jet particle vortex region forced undergo strong stirring, producing cracks, holes, air pore vortex region.(2)SEM EDS analysis proved following two points. 1. main reason cracks, holes, air pore vortex area formation large number brittle intermetallic compounds, brittle intermetallic compound mainly FeAl. 2. due blocking effect steel fiber jet, transition element interface composite plate steel fiber relatively fast.(3)Microhardness test result revealed cracks, holes, air pore vortex region influenced microhardness bonding interface certain extent. microhardness 2A12 aluminum relatively small, microhardness increased decrease 2A12 aluminum content vortex region.(4)The tensile test universal specimen machine proved adding steel fiber could improve antitensile property steel-aluminum composite plates. larger diameter steel fiber, obvious tensile property are. main reason steel fiber material S20910 stainless steel, significantly strengthened explosion process.(5)Fracture morphology analysis indicated 2A12 aluminum typical ductile fracture. ductile fracture far bonding interface obvious explosion strengthening. SS-304 stainless steel layer steel fiber quasi-cleavage fractures, steel fiber showed necking phenomenon fracture. Author ContributionsConceptualization, Y.G. (Yonghong Gao) Y.C.; methodology, Y.G.

IntroductionSince 1929, numerous model created forecast material creep. model built specific boundary constraints, assumptions, operating conditions. Recent study concentrated sine-hyperbolic Kachanov–Rabotnov creep damage model comparisons, examined Haque Stewart [1]. majority literature focused five commonly used models: Kachanov–Rabotnov (KR), Omega, Norton–Bailey (NB), sine-hyperbolic (SH), Theta projection (TP) models, drawback five established model highlighted article [2]. benchmark model Norton–Bailey model, developed Norton Bailey often referred Norton’s power law creep prediction. model built-in component FE software package Abaqus creep analysis [3]. NB model provides starting point developing models. model predict creep deformation behavior time-dependent, inelastic materials. influence NB model limited primary creep regime, also used predict creep deformation secondary creep regime, recorded Brathe Josefson [4]. Material Properties Council’s Omega model, hand, exceptional model commonly utilized prediction owing directness minimal reliance material constants. Prager [5] first presented Omega creep evaluation model 1995, proven track record understanding property interact one another across extensive spectrum materials. Yeom et al. [6] asserted multi-axial damage strain-rate parameter used accurate prediction model. accurately predicts material rupture time lower temperature modelling primary secondary creep regime deformations, explained Prager [7].The KR model another noteworthy model, one early implementation Kachanov Rabotnov’s continuum damage mechanic (CDM) technique, investigated Kachanov [8], studying creep. model’s set coupled equation represent secondary tertiary creep deformation. recent years, significant effort contributing improvement existing version KR law generate contour deformation maps, studied Christopher et al. [9]. Stewart Gordon [10] established strain- damage-based analytical procedure establish transversely isotropic creep damage parameter assessed stress-independent tertiary creep damage coefficients. Theta projection vital creep prediction concept used creep situations. 1985, forecast deformation stage creep failure (including primary, secondary, tertiary), Evans et al. [11] created TP model, another significant model limitations. Stewart’s sine-hyperbolic model [12], Alipour et al. [13] successfully applied high temperature ferritic steels, recent development model creep prediction. three-stage creep damage model accurate simulating primary, secondary, tertiary creep conventional models, interrogated Yang et al. [14].However, model drawback prevent used various physical situations, studied Yao et al. [15]. model provide certain strength weakness different operating temperatures, mechanical loadings, physical conditions. addition, accuracy correlation analysis among model need quantified prediction remaining life material. nothing literature available direct comparison five established creep damage model in-depth analysis physical conditions. Recent research focused modification creep damage model result still conservative, slight change material property may alter results. hypothesized correlation among model help exploiting functional relationships, facilitates transformation one material’s model’s constant others, investigated Haque Stewart [16]. study demonstrated comparison model complication minimum creep strain rate, creep deformation, damage stress rupture material. limitation model studied, presented following paragraph, focal point problem statement article, gap highlighted following sub-section.The MPC Omega model in-service equipment present challenge term estimating cracking strain due lack temperature-dependent material data elevated temperatures. addition, model method demonstrating earlier ongoing degradation within material rupture would probability occur. polynomial exponential curve fitting required, constant model equation material-dependent. Even among identical materials, curve-fitting method prevented Omega model standardized inclusion user-defined creep model. However, Maruyama et al. [17] proposed modified Omega model better creep life prediction material. hand, NB model exclusively focused secondary creep regime account regime predictions. primary tertiary creep prominent, inaccuracy evident, recorded Golan et al. [18]. KR’s model seems promising, albeit requires lot material constant remove primary creep regime analysis. Integrating KR model finite element (FE) analysis problematic replicates within continuous function, explained Dyson [19] study creep plastic damage rupture. TP model relies large quantity empirical data accurately describe single curve precise modeling; numerous curve multiple circumstance necessary along extreme extrapolation inside matching curve similar family precisely conform data, recorded Law et al. [20]. Recently, conquer shortcoming earlier models, SH model created; nonetheless, model conservative approach, yet produce excellent result compared model [21].It significant understand limitation creep failure model analytically computing FE package Abaqus [2]. curve-fitting approach damage evolution one method proposed undo shortcoming model tracking material’s creep deformation behavior tertiary creep regime [22]. difficulty determining creep parameter required FE analysis material implementing creep model may overcome regression analysis [23]. fitness-for-service assessment material also performed creep prediction power law regression [24]. Research ObjectivesThe objective research study evaluate correlate creep damage model standardizing Omega model curve-fitting regression material’s creep data extraction. work included evaluation established creep damage model various physical condition temperature, pressure, loading condition order compare analyze selecting suitable model explicit material, namely SS-304 case. applying correlation among models, assessment model creep strain strain rate creep deformation prediction within specified boundary condition conducted.This study quantified limitation KR, NB, SH, TP model different operating temperatures, pressure, loading condition standardization Omega model correlation analysis computational modeling. Omega model used curve-fitting SH, TP, NB, KR model computational analysis. FE simulation performed several isotherm varying stress levels. model’s material constant also analytically evaluated comparison deformation rate creep strain rate and, ultimately, damage advancement. Data sigmoidal behavior additional creep rupture minimum creep strain rate used correlation study test models’ predictive power. significance work incorporated comparing feasibility models’ fitness suitability predicting creep damage. 2. Creep Damage Constitutive Models 2.1. Norton Bailey ModelAccording Abdallah et al. [25], Norton’s power law invented 1929 depicted Equation (1), acknowledged universally used minimum creep strain rate law based Arrhenius rate equation. 𝜀˙𝑐𝑟=𝐵′𝜎𝑛𝑒𝑥𝑝(−𝑄𝑐𝑅𝑇)𝑡𝑚ε˙cr=B′σnexp−QcRTtm (1) B material constant 𝜀˙𝑐𝑟ε˙cr represents minimum creep strain rate, R represents universal gas constant, represents temperature, σ stand applied stress, power-law exponent n involves variable used calculate material’s kinetic energy various conditions. constant temperature, Equation (1) becomes significantly straightforward. constant temperature simplifies Equation (1), yielding Equation (2). 𝜀˙𝑐𝑟=𝐴𝜎𝑛 𝑡𝑚,ε˙cr=Aσn tm, (2) where, without considering time, ‘t’, Equation (2) becomes: 𝜀˙𝑐𝑟=𝐴𝜎𝑛 ε˙cr=Aσn (3) 𝐴=𝐵′𝑒𝑥𝑝(−𝑄𝑐𝑅𝑇) A=B′exp−QcRT (4) temperature-dependent material constants, A, n, unaffected stress. unit time stress, neither n units. time-differentiated version Equation (3) Segletes et al. [26] studied known power-law creep. 2.2. Omega ModelThe life fraction utilized Omega model (damage parameter, ω) described follows Equation (5): 𝜔=𝑡𝑡𝑟=𝜀˙𝛺𝑡 1+𝜀˙𝛺𝑡 ω=ttr=ε˙Ωt 1+ε˙Ωt (5) tr rupture life, indicates current time, Ω material creep damage constant, 𝜀˙ε˙ current creep strain rate. point time rupture occurs, → tr t/tr → 1, Equation (5) collapses. Thus, life fraction rise zero (nearly) one (0 ≤ t/tr < 1). According Prager [7], creep strain following relationship, shown Equation (6): 1−𝜀˙0𝛺𝑡=1𝑒𝜀˙𝛺 1−ε˙0Ωt=1eε˙Ω (6) Ωt time-dependent damage constant, 𝜀˙0ε˙0 stand primary creep strain rate constant, 𝜀˙ε˙ creep strain. Equation (7) obtained rearranging natural logarithm sides: 𝜀𝐶0˙=−1𝛺 ln(1−𝜀˙0𝛺𝑡) εC0˙=−1Ω ln1−ε˙0Ωt (7) considering derivative regarding time replacing (1 − 𝜀˙0ε˙0Ωt) follows, Equation (8) simplified: 𝜀𝑐˙= 𝜀˙𝑐0 𝑒𝜀𝑐 𝛺 εc˙= ε˙c0 eεc Ω (8) depicted Equation (8), i.e., Omega model, exponent cumulative creep strain assumed, first creep stage considered. Omega model simplest since two constants, ε0 Ω [6]. Equation (7) calculate constant Ω using experimental data. Ω high, material low creep strain rate bulk life rapidly increasing creep strain rate failing. tertiary creep regime, low value Ω mean ample amount time disbursed regime [27]. 2.3. Kachanov–Rabotnov ModelThe formula strain rate damage evolution given Equations (9) (10) standard KR law, applied Stewart Gordon [28]. 𝜀˙ = 𝐴(𝜎1−𝜔 )𝑛,ε˙ = Aσ1−ω n, (9) 𝜔˙ = 𝑀𝜎𝜒(1−𝜔)𝜙,…… 0 ≤ 𝜔 < 1ω˙ = Mσχ1−ωϕ,…… 0 ≤ ω < 1 (10) ϕ, M, χ tertiary creep damage constants, similar Norton’s power-law secondary creep, creep strain, calculated using isochoric creep behavior [29]. Equations (11) (12) created taking Equation (10) performing variable separation, indefinite integration, simplifications. 𝑡(𝜔,𝜎)=1−(1−𝜔)𝜙+1(𝜙+1)𝑀 𝜎𝜒,t(ω,σ)=1−1−ωϕ+1ϕ+1M σχ, (11) ω(𝑡,𝜎) = 1 − [1−(𝜙+1)𝑀 𝜎𝜒 𝑡] 1𝜙+1,ω(t,σ) = 1 − 1−ϕ+1M σχ 1ϕ+1, (12) ω represents current damage, time, calculated using Equations (11) (12), determine current time stress much damage occurring. Using KR model, Gordon Stewart [10] developed strain (SA) damage (DA) approaches. Secondary tertiary creep stage treated using method based material’s behavior analysis. 2.4. Theta Projection ModelThe TP model (primary–secondary–tertiary) created Evans Wilshire [11]. theta creep strain expressed Equation (13) follows: 𝜀˙=𝜃1[1−𝑒𝑥𝑝(−𝜃2𝑡)]+𝜃3 [𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝜃4𝑡)−1]ε˙=θ11−exp−θ2t+θ3 expθ4t−1 (13) shown Equation (13), primary creep strain scale curvature controlled material constant 𝜃1θ1 𝜃2θ2, while, canvas secondary creep strain, scale curvature regulated material constant 𝜃3θ3 𝜃4θ4, recorded Liu et al. [30]. Rearranging Equation (13) obtain time duration, t, given strain value, ε, assumes negligible primary creep strain: 𝑡𝑟=1𝜃4 ln(𝜀𝜃3+1)tr=1θ4 ln(εθ3+1) (14) ε = 𝜀𝑟εr. theta life prediction life fraction/damage accessed Equation (15). 𝑡𝑟=1𝜃4 ln(𝜀𝑟𝜃3+1)tr=1θ4 ln(εrθ3+1) (15) ω=𝑡𝑡𝑟=ln(𝜀𝜃3+1)ln(𝜀𝑟𝜃3+1)ω=ttr=lnεθ3+1lnεrθ3+1 (16) 𝑡𝑟tr stand rupture life, ω denotes damage, 𝜀𝑟εr represents creep ductility. damage evolves zero unity, i.e., 0 ≤ ω < 1 [31]. 2.5. Sine-Hyperbolic ModelAs indicated Equation (17), steady-state/minimum creep strain rate, 𝜀˙𝑐 ε˙c , obtained considering balance in-between hardening recovery mechanism secondary stage creep analysis [13]. Using McVitty’s law, SH model constructed allow non-linear bending minimum creep strain rate vs. stress log–log scale [32]. 𝜀˙𝑐 =𝐵 𝑠𝑖𝑛ℎ(𝜎𝜎𝑠),ε˙c =B sinhσσs, (17) constant indicate creep coefficient secondary creep mechanism transition stress B 𝜎𝑠σs, respectively, h(ω) introduced overall creep strain rate, h(ω) solved Equation (18). ℎ(𝜔)=𝜀𝑐𝑟𝐵 𝑠𝑖𝑛ℎ(𝜎𝜎𝑠)h(ω)=εcrB sinhσσs (18) h(ω) = exp (λ𝜔𝑝)ωp), λ p material constant unit. Incorporating damage Equation (18), new equation take form Equation (19). 𝜔(𝑡)={1𝜆 ln [ 𝜀𝑐𝑟(𝑡)𝐵 𝑠𝑖𝑛ℎ(𝜎𝜎𝑠) ]}1/𝑝ω(t)={1λ ln [ εcr(t)B sinhσσs ]}1/p (19) ω(t) analytical damage calculated creep strain rate 𝜀𝑐𝑟εcr. moment cracking, time taken account, ≈ 𝑡𝑟tr 𝜔𝑐𝑟˙ωcr˙ = 1, creep strain becomes shown Equation (20): 𝜀𝑐𝑟 = 𝜀𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙 ≈𝐵 𝑠𝑖𝑛ℎ(𝜎𝜎𝑠) 𝑒𝑥𝑝 (𝜆)εcr = εfinal ≈B sinhσσs exp (λ) (20) λ=ln [𝜀𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙𝜀𝑚𝑖𝑛];𝜀𝑚𝑖𝑛=𝐵 𝑠𝑖𝑛ℎ(𝜎𝜎𝑠)λ=ln [εfinalεmin];εmin=B sinhσσs (21) symbol λ represents material constant calculated directly available experimental data case. ideal value p suggested 3/2 unit le value λ. Appropriately, creep strain rate sin-h model given Equation (22). scenario, possible derive material constant (λ) directly experimental data. According theory, p 3/2 unit le actual number.

NB Omega model intended estimate damage evolution material’s tertiary creep stage. Using analytical damage calculation, discovered critical damage KR Theta projection model range 0.2 0.3, meaning rupture occurred damage substantially le unity. theory continuum damage mechanic (CDM) contradicts this, highlight damage trajectory nearly infinitely long approach rupture [50]. critical damage sin-h model always resolved unity due material constant λ. result, damage trajectory always finite toward rupture [51].

IntroductionThe subject joining dissimilar metal involves wide range material manufacturing processes. many engineering applications, combined presence stainless steel carbon steel necessary. Thus, applications, fabrication component assembly requires dissimilar weld high quality [1,2]. Challenges related welding dissimilar steel grade include manufacturing pressure vessels, boilers, heat exchanger used power generation industry, petrochemical plants, etc. [3,4]. Austenitic stainless steel pipe widely used transport high temperature-high pressure steam power plants. However, certain temperature pressure, medium carbon steel also meet requirements. result, transition stainless steel grade steel economical certain conditions. Nevertheless, dissimilar welding steel result many metallurgical difficulties, solidification cracks, hydrogen crack formation brittle phases, cause component failure expected service life [[3], [4], [5], [6]].Both solid state [[7], [8], [9], [10]] fusion welding [[11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]] process joining dissimilar metal evident literature. Among fusion welding techniques, tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding mostly adopted application require high level weld quality precision [11,12,[17], [18], [19], [20]]. technique us arc non-consumable tungsten electrode dissimilar metal part welded shielding gas environment. However, joining stainless steel medium carbon steel fusion welding disadvantage forming harmful carbide weld metal. result decarburization grain growth occurring heat affected zone (HAZ) carbon steel, deteriorate mechanical property [21]. time, carbide formation weld metal substantially increase hardness weld possibility crack region well. Differences coefficient thermal expansion thermal conductivity may also problematic [[22], [23], [24]]. Stainless steel tendency expand contract due high heat input welding. hand, carbon steel good conductor heat, cool faster shrink rapidly joint cools. difference increase residual stress junction causing warping misalignment weld component. stress caused thermal expansion contraction exceed strength one material leading crack formation. property failure behavior weld joint largely altered tailoring microstructure. paper provides insight microstructure—mechanical property relationship fusion weld joint two different grade steels, stainless steel SS 304 medium carbon steel EN 8 prepared TIG welding processes.There numerous study microstructure development dissimilar weld steel [[25], [26], [27], [28], [29]], however comprehensive quantitative mechanism relating microstructure mechanical property given. detailed microstructural analysis grain boundary nature, misorientation microstructures, phase boundary relationship mechanical behavior weld specimen investigated study.

Dilatation caused transformation austenite martensite imposes compressive strain surrounding matrix suppresses nucleation microcracks higher strains. Furthermore, accommodate plastic deformation due dilatation, dislocation generated austenite prevents propagation nucleated cracks. event delay necking high ductility achieved. Hard martensite formed due deformation-induced transformation bear load render steel strong. Susceptibility rate austenite-to-martensite transformation play important role controlling mechanical property work hardening behavior metastable austenitic stainless steel influenced stacking fault energy, grain size, deformation temperature, strain rate, stress state deformation history (Ref 6,7,8).Cold working annealing cycle commonly used thickness reduction various metastable austenitic stainless steels. Large number microstructural change take place thermo-mechanical processing. Cold working induces dislocation strain steel annealing, dislocation get annihilated, strain get relieved. Furthermore, due recrystallization recovery annealing, substantial difference grain size annealed cold worked steels. Since, strain, prior dislocation density grain size influence deformation-induced transformation austenite martensite, difference flow behavior work hardening tendency cold worked annealed steel expected.Previously, Fargas (Ref 9) compared deformation-induced transformation behavior annealed cold-worked metastable austenitic stainless steel subjecting shot peening. shot peening, 30% increase martensite content reported annealed specimen case cold worked specimens, increase martensite content limited 15% only. Khieri et al. (Ref 10) compared work hardening behavior differently annealed 316L stainless steel plate initially cold worked 70%. increase annealing temperature 850 1050 °C, substantial increase grain size 1.8 32 μm achieved. 83% 60% martensite estimated present gauge portion broken tensile steel specimen coarse fine grains, respectively. Further, uniform elongation, toughness work hardening rate steel annealed 1050 °C observed higher side compared steel annealed 850 °C. difference increment martensite content application plastic strain similar magnitude clearly indicates microstructural difference annealed cold worked specimen influence austenite-to-martensite transformation stainless steels. Similar observation reported investigator also (Ref 11, 12).Earlier study limited understanding influence grain size (altered proper thermomechanical processing) yielding work hardening behavior austenitic stainless steels. Along increased grain size, substantial decrease dislocation density release strain energy take place annealing cold worked samples. influence dislocation density deformation-induced transformation examined several researchers, resulting contrasting outcomes. Shintani et al. (Ref 13) Liu et al. (Ref 14) observed higher dislocation density led increased fraction martensite. attributed role dislocation promoting plastic deformation facilitating strain accommodation transformation austenite martensite. Suzuki et al. (Ref 15) Shin et al. (Ref 16) emphasized importance external internal stress resulting dislocation accumulation initiating strain-induced nucleation martensite. In-depth transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigation Liu et al. (Ref 14), Kikuchi et al. (Ref 17), Fang Dahl (Ref 18) confirmed stress field resulting high density dislocation contributed phase transformation progression. Recent in-situ TEM study (Ref 19) provide insights, demonstrating dislocation facilitate austenite-to-martensite phase transformation austenitic stainless steels. Chatterjee et al. (Ref 20) theoretical approach suggested existence critical strain beyond generated dislocation stabilized austenite deformation-induced transformation. According them, presence high density dislocation could prevent deformation-induced transformation. theoretical prediction also aligned experimental observations.It clear previous literature conflict understanding influence dislocation deformation-induced transformation austenitic stainless steels. Further, influence dislocation work hardening behavior comprehensively studied. Investigation area could provide valuable insight interplay dislocation density martensite transformation, contributing deeper understanding mechanical response difference deformation mechanism as-rolled annealed metastable austenitic stainless steels.In work, as-rolled ASS304 plate annealed different durations. influence grain size initial dislocation density as-received annealed steel plate work hardening rate kinetics deformation-induced transformation investigated using interrupted tensile deformation room temperature, scanning electron microscope x-ray diffraction analysis. Evolution dislocation deformation-induced martensite tensile deformation recorded analyzing diffraction peak steel interrupted various stain correlated initial grain size dislocation density. Difference deformation mechanism cold rolled annealed steel thereafter proposed. latter part manuscript, influence grain size stacking fault energy deformation mechanism estimated based first principle compared experimental observations.2 Experimental Procedure2.1 Material, Processing Evaluation Mechanical Behavior304 austenitic stainless steel received form rolled plate dimension 500 mm × 50 mm × 10 mm. chemical composition 304 austenitic stainless steel used work given Table 1. chemical composition measured SPECTROMAXx arc spark optical emission spectroscopy metal analyzer.

Resistance posed movement dislocation dislocation plastic deformation aid strengthening work hardening capacity. Dislocation density influenced amount applied cold work annealing. Previous study deformation-induced austenite-to-martensite transformation also reported influence dislocation density susceptibility transformation (Ref 42,43,44). Since present work, cold worked annealed specimen involved, imperative prior knowledge dislocation density investigated specimen application tensile strains. section, evolution dislocation density tensile deformation recorded related deformation-induced transformation kinetics.Table 5 list effective strain, domain size dislocation density austenite calculated measurement various attribute γ200 peak x-ray diffraction profile unstrained strained steel specimen (shown Fig. 9), discussed Sect. 2 paper. sample, increasing applied strain, increase effective strain (ε) microstructural level decrease domain size (η). ε unstrained AR 0.0016 η 342 nm. case unstrained A120 specimens, ε 0.0006 domain size 641 nm. high value effective strain small domain size unstrained AR due insufficient annealing prior cold worked as-received steel.

Despite high initial dislocation density AR, rate dislocation generate plastic deformation small compared A120 A360. 60 80% strains, dislocation density A120 A360 higher AR.Fig. 11Dislocation density AR, A120, A360 application strain. Initially small strain (20 40%), high dislocation density AR compared A120 A360 larger strain (60 80%) A120 A360 higher dislocation densityFull size imageIt noted Fig. 11 Table 5 small strain (< 50%), A360 A120, dislocation density small compared AR. High dislocation density AR render steep increase work hardening rate initial phase deformation, observed regime B Fig. 5. Fig. 11 Table 5, higher strain (greater 50%), high dislocation density A120 A360 noted dislocation density AR comparatively small. Generation large number dislocation A120 A360 lead steep increase work hardening rate higher strain compared AR (Fig. 4(b), 5, 6 7) regime C.During tensile straining, investigated steels, austenite also undergone deformation-induced transformation martensite. Tables 4 5, evident A360 coarser grains, large domain size small dislocation density, large fraction martensite formed AR specimen fine grains, high dislocation density small domains, fraction martensite formed relatively small. worth pondering AR specimen le tendency deformation-induced austenite-to-martensite transformation vice versa annealed A120 A360 specimens.It well known austenite-to-martensite transformation accompanied volume expansion order 4%. accommodate volume expansion, untransformed austenite undergoes plastic deformation, large number dislocation generated surrounding transformed martensite. Prior plastic deformation induces heavy dislocation density austenite matrix restrict expansion volume accompanying austenite-to-martensite transformation transformation get retarded (Ref 45,46,47).According Chatterjee et al. (Ref 20), large strain austenite restricts motion glissile interface prevents austenite-to-martensite transformation. suggests existence sufficient number dislocation could prevent martensite growing austenite high plastic strains. small plastic strains, dislocation density sufficient influence rate austenite-to-martensite transformation. situation schematically shown Fig. 12. Dislocation density assumed vary linearly plastic strain (εp), per relation ρ = εp/bL, b Burger’s vector L average distance moved dislocation (Ref 20). critical plastic strain (εpc), dislocation density austenite sufficient prevent austenite-to-martensite transformation. subjected plastic strain εpc, austenite relatively stable toward deformation-induced transformation. case A120 A360, rate formation martensite relatively higher due low dislocation density small strain (Fig. 8).Fig. 12Schematic representation critical plastic strain required generation critical dislocation density inhibit deformation-induced transformationFull size imageDislocation density unstrained A120 0.07 × 1014/m2, almost 7 time smaller unstrained AR. Further, small dislocation density strain < 50% A120 A360 (Fig. 11 Table 5) led easy nucleation martensite higher transformation rate AR due high initial dislocation density high dislocation density specimen strained strain < 50%, deformation-induced transformation restricted. Thus, initial dislocation density rate dislocation generating strain application play important role controlling deformation-induced transformation austenite martensite.The difference work hardening behavior among investigated steel present investigation explained classical Ashby’s model (Ref 48). model provides comprehensive explanation relationship among work hardening, grain size, phase distribution plastically non-homogeneous alloys. stored dislocations, statistically stored within material’s microstructure, act obstacle motion dislocations. material undergoes plastic deformation, dislocation generated move within crystal lattice. gliding dislocation interact array stored dislocations, resulting increased resistance motion. resistance hinders motion dislocations, resulting increase material’s strength hardness.The AR, A120, A360 specimen 304 stainless steels, exhibiting polycrystal face-centered cubic (FCC) structure different grain sizes, contain statistically stored dislocation (SSDs) unstrained state. three specimen differ number SSDs unstrained state. Dislocation density density SSDs unstrained state.

Dilatation accompanied deformation-induced transformation must accommodated soft austenite matrix. Consequently, deformation gradient occur untransformed austenite, characterized wavelength corresponding dynamically decreasing spacing \(\alpha {\prime}\)-martensite increasing fraction described Ashby (Ref 48). gradient arise due development microstructure, resulting plastically non-homogeneous behavior SS304. lead formation additional GNDs untransformed austenite, shown Fig. 13(d) 14(d). Formation GNDs becomes essential straining enable compatible deformation accommodate deformation gradients. Total dislocation density situation sum SSDs GNDs.In A120 A360 due formation large amount martensite tensile straining higher strain (Table 4), accommodate dilatation, large number additional GNDs generated. hand, AR, number GNDs generated relatively small due small fraction martensite formed larger strains. According Kundu Field (Ref 42), strengthening proportional dislocation density sum SSDs GNDs. presence larger number GNDs contributes steep increase work hardening rate A120 A360 compared AR specimen higher strains. Interestingly tensile deformation metastable austenitic stainless steels, increase GNDs dynamic nature since fraction size martensite dynamically increasing. per Ashby (Ref 31), geometric slip distance (\({\lambda }_{{\rm {G}}}\)) inversely proportional (\(f\)/\(r\)) \(f\) \(r\) fraction size martensite, respectively. large \(f\)/\(r\) ratio, \({\lambda }_{{\rm {G}}}\) small lead formation large number GNDs subsequently surpass SSDs. substantially aid increasing work hardening rate. High \(f\)/\(r\) ratio possible fraction martensite large, size martensite phase small. possible nucleation rate martensite high growth rate small. Estimation fraction size stage straining requires detailed characterization taken research.3.6 Influence Grain Size Deformation-Induced TransformationIn present manuscript, difference evolution martensite strain far understood due difference initial dislocation density. section discus influence variation grain size stacking fault energy deformation-induced transformation austenite martensite.

Thus, grain size also influence fraction deformation-induced martensite. Different susceptibility austenite undergo deformation-induced transformation AR, A120 A360 influence work hardening tendency noted Fig. 4 5 transformation rate shown Fig. 8.From Fig. 4, small critical strain required nucleate martensite case AR indicates deformation-induced martensite transformation getting initiated early steel compared A120 A360. Early formation deformation-induced martensite lead large number grain boundary present AR. shown Fig. 16, shear band nucleate grain boundary intersect form martensite. large number grain boundaries, high probability intersection shear band resulting rapid nucleation martensite. A120 A360 due small number grain boundaries, relatively small number nucleation site form leading delay martensite nucleation. High initial dislocation density AR restricts growth nucleated martensite A120 A360 due small initial dislocation density, growth nucleated martensite rapid discussed Sect. 3.5. Thus, AR, although nucleation deformation-induced martensite taking place small strains, growth retarded due presence large number dislocation larger tendency form twin A120 A360, nucleation deformation-induced martensite delayed, growth thereafter rapid due presence small number dislocations.As noted study, different tendency AR, A120, A360 undergo deformation-induced transformation due following two reasons: (a) Difference initial dislocation density investigated specimen (b) Tendency austenite deform formation twins/\(\epsilon \)-martensite. high initial dislocation density, AR pose relatively large resistance toward deformation-induced transformation end small fraction deformation-induced martensite strain close fracture. hand, A120 A360 substantially low dislocation density, formation deformation-induced martensite relatively much rapid. Furthermore, due relatively high tendency austenite deform twinning mode, formation martensite le preferred AR compared A120 A360 proved value shear stress critical radius required nucleation twin \(\epsilon \)-martensite.Difference tendency austenite undergo deformation-induced transformation reflected work hardening curve shown Fig. 4, 5, 6, 7. understood rate work hardening take place cumulative effect fraction hard martensite number GNDs generated accommodate dilatation caused due deformation-induced transformation. Since annealed A120 A360, fraction deformation-induced martensite GNDs higher, increase work hardening rate rapid compared AR.3.7 Microstructural Factors Influencing Ductility Work Hardening Behavior 304 SSIt clear discussion previous section A120 A360 exhibit high ductility compared AR. due high work hardening tendency annealed sample compared AR. A120 A360, due small SFE, large tendency formation \(\epsilon \)-martensite application strain transforms \(\alpha {\prime}\)-martensite. Small dislocation density annealed sample render deformation induced transformation take place higher rate. resistance deformation induced transformation take place thus small formation hard martensite take place higher rate compared AR. lead development multiphase microstructure hard martensite phase embedded soft austenite matrix. application tensile strain, rapid nucleation martensite take place accommodate accompanying volume change, GNDs generated interact already present SSDs dislocation material. Interaction dislocation steel increasing fraction hard martensite GNDs lead increase work hardening tendency ductility annealed samples.In AR, due small \(\epsilon \)-martensite nucleation, tendency deformation induced transformation small. Further, high dislocation density sample retard deformation induced transformation. Due small tendency deformation induced transformation, fraction hard martensite formed subsequent generation GNDs small. Unlike annealed samples, interaction dislocation AR strong annealed samples. result small work hardening tendency small ductility compared annealed A120 A360 samples. Further, AR, twinned regions, different crystallographic orientations, create area stress concentration (Ref 37, 38, 57). result localized deformation early fracture AR, contributing reduced % elongation small work hardening tendency.It thus clear present study substantial difference work hardening behavior as-rolled annealed steels. compared as-rolled steels, annealed steel show better work hardening response. Work hardening behavior ductility could thus conveniently tailored designing annealing schedule. Less annealed sample larger dislocation density small grain compared fully annealed steels. render former exhibit small work hardening tendency. aspect could useful automotive aerospace application 304 stainless steel undergo operation like deep drawing, stretching, etc., high formability critical requirement.4 Conclusions 1. significant difference work hardening rate as-rolled annealed 304 metastable austenitic stainless steels. 2. As-rolled stainless steel exhibit rapid increase work hardening rate low strain due high initial dislocation density. hand, higher strains, annealed stainless steel work-hardened relatively higher rate due rapid formation deformation-induced martensite generation large number GNDs accommodate dilatation due deformation-induced transformation. 3. \({\gamma }_{{\rm {app}}}\) small coarse grain steel higher fine grain steel. Minor difference \({\gamma }_{{\rm {app}}}\) influence transformation sequence deformation-induced transformation. higher \({\gamma }_{{\rm {app}}}\), twin formation preferable compared \(\epsilon \)-martensite. 4. Low dislocation density, high tendency deformation-induced transformation large grain size lead high ductility annealed steels. relatively high tendency twinning, high dislocation density, small susceptibility undergo deformation-induced transformation led relatively small ductility fine-grain cold-rolled stainless steel.

IntroductionTitanium alloy light weight exhibit good strength weight ratio. Stainless steel (SS) posse good corrosion resistance property high tensile strength. component material assembled together, many industry like nuclear petrochemical [1]. make desirable join Ti alloy SS. However, thermal expansion coefficient diffusivities significantly different. lead crack formation intermetallic compound (IMCs) conventional fusion welding [2]. Laser welding Ti alloy SS successfully performed, however, large amount brittle IMCs like FeTi, Fe2Ti Ti5Fe17Cr5 observed interface [3]. Copper based filler metal [2,4] copper interlayer [5] attempted fusion welding method improvement crack resistance reported Fe–Ti IMCs replaced Ti–Cu IMCs. Solid state joining (SSJ) technique eliminate dissimilar joining issue rooted liquefaction-solidification nature fusion welding methods. Diffusion bonding SSJ technique well investigated joining steel Ti alloys. Upon diffusion bonding, σ phase steel, β-Ti many type IMCs (Fe–Ti, Fe–Cr, Cr–Ti, etc.) reported interface steel Ti [6,7]. Impulse pressure diffusion bonding (pressure varied frequency process) resulted reduced IMCs improved tensile strength [8]. Also, interlayer Ni [9], Cu [10] Ag [11] tried reduce brittle IMCs. However, long incubation time (up hours) required diffusion bonding promotes IMC formation [6], major limitation process. Friction stir welding (FSW) SSJ method capable dissimilar joining (Al6061-Copper [13], Al6013-SS [14] Al6061–Ti6Al4V [15]), significantly le processing/incubation time. lead smaller Fe–Ti IMCs thickness SS-Ti alloy joints, upon FSW (∼1 μm [12]) compared diffusion bonding (10–20 μm [7]). However, limited literature available FSW SS pure Ti. Liao et al. performed friction stir lap welding SS commercially pure Ti (CP–Ti) observed intermixed region FeTi IMC particle β-Ti [12]. Gao et al. [16] created friction stir lap weld different probe length tool noticed intermixing increase probe length, similar FeTi IMC particle β-Ti intermixed region [12]. Ishida et al. reported σ phase steel & Ni–Ti IMCs, addition Fe–Ti IMCs β-Ti friction stir lap joint SS CP-Ti [17]. Among study FSW SS pure Ti, almost investigation FSW performed lap configuration [12,[16], [17], [18]]. might allow larger surface surface contact. However, may lead intermixing, higher IMC formation IMC dispersion stir zone. author's knowledge, Li et al. reported FSW medium carbon steel Ti6Al4V butt configuration, observed FeTi IMC interface [19]. However, friction stir butt welding SS pure Ti yet reported. objective work perform study friction stir butt welding SS 304 CP-Ti.

So, FeTi considered EBSD scan. FeTi expected per composition EDS point scan location 3 (Table 2). Ishida et al. observed similar composition EDS FeTi IMC [17]. FeTi IMC β-Ti also reported previously friction stir lap weld SS CP-Ti [12,16]. However, σ phase steel & Ni–Ti IMCs observed present welds, noticed (in addition FeTi IMC β-Ti) Ishida et al. friction stir lap weld SS CP-Ti [17]. Grain boundary (black lines) subgrain boundary (white lines) considered misorientation angle 10° 2°, respectively. Fig. 4(a) show high amount subgrains formed SS austenite grains. Subgrain boundary also visible band contrast map lower value band contrast. Band contrast value higher recrystallized recovered region, lower deformed (yet unrecrystallized & unrecovered) region [21]. FSW, material plastically deformed high strain rate elevated temperature [22]. led continuous dynamic recrystallization (CDRX) SS resulted high angle grain boundaries. Similar CDRX duplex low density steel upon high temperature tensile deformation (for strain rate 10−1 s−1) observed Abedi et al. [23]. However, subgrain boundary formation limited Ti. Fig. 4(c), average band contrast value higher SS (158) compared Ti (69.2). high band contrast SS due CDRX FSW. low band contrast Ti suggests strain retained upon FSW. strain might induced due phase transformation β-Ti α-Ti upon FSW (further discussed below).Download : Download high-res image (1MB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 4.

However, work, weld performed 600 rpm 700 rpm. So, expected maximum temperature encountered le 1350 K. Wang et al. presented Ti–Fe–Cr ternary phase diagram 1073 K 1273 K [26]. β-transus temperature pure-Ti 1188 K [27]. However, Ti–Fe–Cr system 1073 K, α-Ti β-Ti transformation occurs Fe Cr content 5%. suggests higher Fe Cr content Ti reduce β-transus temperature. FSW, material heated up, Fe Cr SS diffused CP-Ti encouraged α-Ti β-Ti transformation. Upon cooling, β-Ti transformed back α-Ti region lower Fe Cr content. resulted α-Ti needle location 6 7 (Fig. 6(a)). Lack Fe Cr location 8 led complete transformation α-Ti (Fig. 6(a)). location 4 5 higher Fe Cr content, β-Ti remains stable room temperature. Fig. 4(b), α-Ti precipitate observed inβ-Ti. similar observation, Zhan et al. reported α-Ti precipitate β-Ti alloy (Ti–6Cr–5Mo–5V–4Al) high strain rate deformation elevated temperature Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar testing. dislocation structure suggested nucleation site α-Ti precipitation [28]. Li et al. also observed α-Ti precipitate β-Ti alloy upon severe plastic deformation compression test enrichment Ti α-Ti precipitate [29]. present work (Fig. 4(c), lower band contrast near α-Ti precipitate suggests α-Ti precipitate formed dislocation structures. So, FSW SS CP-Ti, β-Ti form SS-Ti interface due Fe Cr diffusion SS CP-Ti dislocation structure formed β-Ti due straining. dislocation structure act site α-Ti precipitation due higher diffusion Ti compared Fe Cr (DTiTi>DFeTi & DTiTi>DCrTi, Table 1).From Fig. 4(a), FeTi noticed either side SS-Ti interface, 350 nm thickness SS 180 nm thickness CP-Ti side. Although diffusion coefficient Fe Ti (DFeTi) higher diffusion coefficient Ti Fe (DTiFe, Table 1). due β-Ti stabilization Fe.

IntroductionStainless steel (SS) corrosion-resistant steel imparts minimum amount 11% chromium. type steel divided four categories: ferritic, martensitic, austenitic, austenitic + ferritic (or duplex) SS. steel distinguished according microstructural appearance room temperature [1]. Further, microstructure orientation influenced alloy composition. Although SS known corrosion-resistant properties, property like fracture toughness oxidative resistance altered addition alloying elements. example, Nb Ti improve IGC (inter-granular corrosion) resistance property SS absorbing carbon form carbides. Machinability enhanced sulphur responsible form manganese sulphide. Nitrogen help improve strength steel. good surface finish anti-corrosion properties, SS used various industry like chemical, aerospace, medical, pharmaceutical, food processing, even household well jewelry work [2].Metallography stainless steel becomes important quality control throughout production process. research area includes grain size measurement, identification, evaluation distribution γ, δ, α′, σ, various carbide (like M23C6), etc. corrosion oxidation measurement also interesting topic past decade. austenitic grade contains 17–24% Cr, 9–25% Ni, 2–4% Mo little proportion Ti Nb form carbide matrix [3]. SS posse good malleability, formability, machinability. property SS influenced cold working usually, affected heat treatment. Instead, quenching may lead formation soft structure. high-temperature exposure nearly 700 °C lead formation carbide γ-matrix. Further, condition responsible reduction Cr γ-matrix thereby enhancement IGC [4, 5].

IntroductionHigh-entropy alloy (HEA), also called multi-principal element alloy, contains least five elements, making different traditional alloy [1,2]. content element HEA maintained 5%–35%, multi-principal element endowed HEAs four core effects: thermodynamic effect high entropy, dynamic effect sluggish diffusion, microstructural effect lattice distortion, cocktail effect mechanical performance [[3], [4], [5]].CrMnFeCoNi HEA, firstly developed Cantor 2004 [6], among systematically studied HEAs. Given high mixing entropy, CrMnFeCoNi HEA consists single face-centered cubic solid solution nearly maintained even several serious thermal machining process [7,8]. unique microstructure character CrMnFeCoNi HEA exhibit several considerable properties, good ductility, high fracture toughness, reliable strength, outstanding processability [[9], [10], [11]]. remarkable property make HEA promising structural material.However, many aspect CrMnFeCoNi HEA still require investigation alloy used practical one aspect weldability [12]. Several fusion welding methods, electron beam welding laser welding, used explore weldability CrMnFeCoNi HEA. However, composition segregation induced multi-principal elements, oxidation caused lack protection, strong trend grain growth reduce strength joint [[12], [13], [14]]. Friction stir weld, serious requirement base metal (BM) structure, used join CrMnFeCoNi HEA. improves strength joint grain refinement [15,16]. afore-mentioned literature weldability CrMnFeCoNi HEA undeniably benefit potential application HEA. Meanwhile, joint single material cannot always satisfy requirement modern industry. Dissimilar joint attracted considerable attention recent year [17], study dissimilar joint CrMnFeCoNi HEA traditional alloy few.Stainless steel (SS) common material exhibit good mechanical property, outstanding corrosion resistance, good weldability; typically joined material [18,19]. nuclear plant, example, Ti alloy/SS dissimilar brazing joint widely used, Ti–based intermetallic compound (IMCs) embrittle joint [20,21]. Fe, Cr, Ni main constituent element SS CrMnFeCoNi HEA. similarity 304 SS CrMnFeCoNi HEA reduce formation IMCs replace Ti/SS joint nuclear plants. Thus, dissimilar joint CrMnFeCoNi HEA 304 SS investigated.Brazing suitable dissimilar joint complex structures, IMCs grain growth joint decreased selecting appropriate filler metal (FM) [22].

Interlayers introduced base material limit formation IMCs conventional joining methods, example, vanadium tantalum interlayer stainless steel (SS 304) commercially pure titanium (CP-Ti) laser welding [5]. However, significant reduction IMC thickness could achieved. IMCs seen welding CP-Ti SS 304 Fe-Ti, Cr-Ti, Ni–Ti IMCs [6]. recently, address IMC formation dissimilar interface, interlayer Cu [7], Nb [8], Ag [9], Ni [10] combination Ni + Nb [11] utilized join titanium alloy stainless steels. interlayer reduces thickness IMC limiting direct elemental diffusion substrate [12]. Although use interlayer may inhibit/reduce Fe-Ti IMCs, another IMC respective interlayer (Cu-Ti Cu interlayer, Ni–Ti Ni interlayer, etc.) replaces Fe-Ti IMCs, comparatively le brittle Fe-Ti. complete elimination IMC formation extremely difficult dissimilar joining. However, improved joint performance achieved reducing IMC growth. fusion welding process involve melting solidification joint formation, leading significant intermixing high temperature relatively longer period. factor prevent significant reduction IMCs growth.The material melt solidify solid-state joining techniques, reduce IMC formation. Friction stir welding (FSW) one technique explored dissimilar joining [13]. study explored welding steel Ti FSW. Various phase IMCs like sigma, Fe2Ti, Cr2Ti, Fe2Ti4O, α-Ti noticed FSW CP-Ti AISI 316L, adversely affected joint strength [14]. Zhang et al. performed FSW lap configuration Ti6Al4V plate colony β grain α grain [15]. stir zone fine lamellar α + β microstructure, led improved tensile strength elongation. underwater FSW FSW liquid nitrogen explored welding Al Mg alloy control grain size [16]. Due lower peak temperature processes, brittle IMCs reported suppressed. joint underwater FSW Al–Mg alloy low carbon steel exhibited improved mechanical property due stir zone refined grain [17].Friction stir spot welding (FSSW) similar FSW used fabricating spot welds. dissimilar FSSW face similar challenge FSW. Boucherit et. al. noticed Al-Cu IMCs FSSWed joint Al Cu [18]. Zn interlayer Al Cu FSSW inhibited formation Al4Cu9 IMC; however, shear tensile characteristic remained unaffected, respect joint without Zn interlayer. low carbon steel Al 6063, impact pin length dissimilar FSSWed joint studied Piccini et al. [19]. increase tool penetration reduction pin length led improved load bearing capacity dissimilar joints. Similarly, tool penetration, higher tensile shear load achieved dissimilar FSSWed joint Al–Mg alloy low-carbon steel [20]. However, excessive penetration led deterioration joint properties. excessive tool penetration resulted deformation Al plate weld defect formed joining interface. Alaeibehmand et al. performed FSSW aluminium (AA6061) dual phase (DP600) steel pinless tool [21]. dissimilar interface, gray band Fe2Al5Zn0.4 IMC reported. Furthermore, band towards SS side smooth interface, comparison discontinuous rough interface Al side.The effect tool penetration, pin length, interlayer material studied IMCs dissimilar FSSW joints. dwell time another critical process input affect joint property IMC formation. dwell time promotes higher heat generation, help material movement mixing joint creation. However, dwell time also lead higher peak temperature incubation time IMC formation. research focus impact dwell duration elemental diffusion IMC growth FSSW CP-Ti SS 304. Furthermore, effectiveness dwell time evaluated towards inhibition/reduction IMC formation growth dissimilar FSSW. purpose, microstructure phases, including IMCs mechanical properties, investigated SS 304 CP-Ti joint prepared different dwell times.2 Numerical approachA three-dimensional thermal model created FSSW SS 304 CP-Ti, estimate temperature profile joint interface.

Figure 5 show schematic phase transformation mechanism dissimilar interface. Fig. 5, temperature rise accelerates diffusion element across boundary, influence stability β-Ti phase Fe-Ti IMC near interface. Figure 6 show micrographs joint prepared dwell time 0 s, 2.5 s, 5 s, 10 s, respectively. Primarily, SS 304 consists austenitic phase (γ-Fe) CP-Ti consists α-Ti phase.Fig. 5Evolution phase transformation FSSW processFull size imageFig. 6Dissimilar joint interface dwell time 0 s, b 2.5 s, c 5 s, 10 sFull size imageDuring FSSW, temperature rise led phase transformation α-Ti β-Ti near CP-Ti side dissimilar interface, transforms back majorly α-Ti. phase transformation SS 304 noticed, peak temperature high enough trigger γ-Fe δ-Fe transformation (~ 1500 K [36]). Fe-Ti IMCs noticed dissimilar SS 304-CP-Ti interface, discussed next sub-section. β-transus temperature CP-Ti 882 ± 2 °C [37] FSSW transformation α-Ti β-Ti take place. cooling, β-Ti transforms back α-Ti. However, Cr Fe, Ni diffuse SS 304 side CP-Ti side, β-Ti stabilizer lower temperature [38]. lead β-Ti next dissimilar interface Fe/Cr/Ni rich region α-β Ti needle β-Ti α-Ti regions, β-Ti transforms α-Ti cooling, seen Fig. 5c. kind α-β Ti needle also seen different joint made SS Ti [39,40,41].From Fig. 6, α-β needle band thickest 5 weld dwell thickness reduces weld dwell time increases. peak temperature increase dwell time, encourages higher/more diffusion β-Ti stabilizing element (Fe, Cr, Ni) towards CP-Ti side. β-Ti (from stabilizing effect Fe, Cr, Ni) reduces thickness α-β needles. promotes higher thickness β-Ti lower thickness α-β needle band dwell time increase (Fig. 6a–d).5.4 EBSD phase map XRDElectron back scattered diffraction (EBSD) analysis performed higher magnification representative sample (20 dwell), confirm phase present joining interface. Figure 7 show EBSD phase map near joining interface. β-Ti formed next α-β Ti needles. phase fraction β-Ti ~ 20%. Near interface, needle structure rich β-Ti and, away interface, major phase α-Ti. SS304 side, phase transformation observed primarily γ-austenite phase present. X-ray diffraction (XRD) also performed confirm phases. addition γ-austenite, α-Ti, β-Ti, Fe-Ti IMCs also noticed XRD 2θ plot (Fig. 7b). Similar peak β-Ti Fe-Ti IMCs also reported previous study [39, 40, 42, 43] joining SS Ti.Fig. 7A EBSD phase map b XRD 2θ plot joining interfaceFull size image5.5 β-Ti Fe-Ti IMC estimationFigure 8 show experimentally measured numerically predicted β-Ti Fe-Ti IMC thicknesses. IMC thickness measured SEM image (Figs. 4a 6). Fig. 8, β-Ti Fe-Ti IMC thickness increase dwell time increases. higher dwell time promotes heat generation, lead higher peak temperature (Eq. 1) encourages IMC formation (Eqs. 8 9). β-Ti thickness 0 s, 2.5 s, 5 s, 10 s, 20 weld dwell 1.5 μm, 2.6 μm, 5.8 μm, 11.1 μm, respectively. numerically predicted β-Ti thickness 2.5 s, 5 s, 10 s, 20 dwell time 0.5 μm, 1 μm, 4.2 μm, 9.1 μm, respectively. Similarly, Fe-Ti IMC thickness 2.5 s, 5 s, 10 s, 20 dwell time SEM image 0.2 μm, 0.3 μm, 0.7 μm, 1 μm, respectively. Also, predicted IMC thickness corresponding dwell time 0.1 μm, 0.2 μm, 0.3 μm, 2 μm, respectively. Numerically predicted thickness accordance experimental observations. β-Ti Fe-Ti IMC thickness predicted 0 dwell time plunging phase modelled. high dwell times, model predicts Fe-Ti IMC thickness. could due inconsistent diffusion constant activation energy Fe-Ti (Table 2) high temperature, high dwell time.Fig. 8Experimental predicted thickness β-Ti b Fe-Ti IMC, different dwell timesFull size image5.6 Shear strength (tensile) resultsFor FSSW condition, three shear strength (tensile) test conducted. Figure 9 display tensile shear test result various dwell times. Shear strength (tensile) go ~ 4.5 ~ 8 kN dwell time go 2.5 10 s. Furthermore, increase dwell time 20 led reduced shear strength (tensile) ~ 7 kN. Fig. 9, β-Ti thickness also increase dwell time increases. β-Ti relatively ductile, α-β alloy Ti known exhibit higher strength compared pure (α β) Ti.Fig. 9Tensile shear strength joint prepared different dwell timesFull size imageThe presence β-Ti dissimilar interface tends improve joint strength. However, temperature increase higher dwell time, Fe-Ti IMC also increase dissimilar interface. Fe-Ti IMCs relatively brittle. excessive presence Fe-Ti IMCs dissimilar interface would promote abrupt brittle failure lower strength. suggests lower dwell time (up 10 s), presence β-Ti relatively le Fe-Ti IMC (thickness < 1 μm (Sect. 5.5)) lead improved/higher shear strength (tensile). However, joint prepared highest dwell time 20 s, Fe-Ti IMC thickness 1 μm reduces shear strength (tensile). fracture surface representative shear test (tensile) specimen examined SEM. feature fracture surface indicated primarily brittle failure. Results EDS analysis fracture surface joint prepared 20 dwell time shown Fig. 10. Point EDS performed three locations, corresponding value listed alongside. considerable Fe Ti presence location strongly indicates Fe-Ti IMCs. Furthermore, dissimilar interface Fe-Ti IMC location fracture upon shear strength (tensile) test.Fig. 10SEM image elemental distribution EDS fractured surface joint prepared 20 weld dwellFull size imageThe numerical simulation show dwell time affect heat generation dissimilar interface, interface temperature increase dwell time increases. temperature Ti side increase beyond β-transus temperature, lead α-Ti β-Ti phase transformation heating. β-Ti phase body-centered cubic (BCC) crystal structure, stable elevated temperature temperature decreases, β-Ti transforms α-Ti phase, hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structure. temperature β-transus, change crystal structure HCP BCC enables open crystallography easy diffusion elements. SS304 side, Fe, Cr, Ni diffused towards CP-Ti side Ti CP-Ti side, diffused towards SS304 side. Fe, Cr, Ni (β-Ti stabilizers) stabilized β-Ti near interface inhibited complete transformation β-Ti α-Ti cooling. diffusion element titanium lattice lower eutectoid transformation temperature encourages β-Ti α-β needle structure cooling [44]. Also, presence Fe, Cr, Ni Ti lattice reduces mobility titanium atom (The atomic size factor Fe, Cr, Ni compatible β-Ti phase titanium.), making difficult crystal lattice rearrange transform α-Ti phase.As dwell time increases, phase fraction β-Ti Fe-Ti IMC increases, affect mechanical property joint. higher phase fraction β-Ti improves strength. Previously, reported phase fraction β-Ti increases, initially, strength increases; however, increase β-Ti phase fraction decrease strength [45, 46]. Similarly current study, dwell time increase 10 s, presence β-Ti phase Fe-Ti IMC increase tensile shear strength joint. However, higher dwell time (more 10 s) lead β-Ti Fe-Ti IMC, make joint brittle deteriorates join performance.6 ConclusionFor friction stir spot welding Ti steel lap configuration, dwell time important process parameter. study investigates dissimilar FSSW CP-Ti SS 304, experimentally numerically. dwell time varied across dissimilar FSSWed joint CP-Ti SS 304. tensile testing characterization FSSW joint revealed joint shear strength microstructure dissimilar interface. temperature profile FSSW, elemental distribution, phase (β-Ti Fe-Ti IMC) thickness dissimilar interface estimated numerically. presence phase confirmed EBSD phase map XRD 2θ analysis. following inference made analysis: (1) Dwell time important process parameter affect heat generation process. temperature joning interface increase dwell time increases, enables interdiffusion element across interface. (2) numerical experimental result demonstrate dwell time increases, Fe SS side diffuses larger depth CP-Ti side. Cr Ni SS side also diffused towards CP-Ti side. (3) microstructural analysis show significant change SS 304 side, FSSW joints. Ti side, α-Ti transforms β-Ti heating. diffusion Fe, Cr, Ni CP-Ti side stabilizes β-Ti phase near interface inhibited complete transformation β-Ti α-Ti upon cooling. Furthermore, significant presence Fe Ti led formation Fe-Ti intermetallics, confirmed EBSD phase map XRD. (4) shear strength (tensile) tests, dwell time increase shear strength (tensile) initially increases, however increase dwell time reduces joint strength. maximum shear strength (tensile) ~ 8 kN achieved corresponding to10 dwell time. joint strengthened presence β-Ti dissimilar interface, presence Fe-Ti IMCs encourages abrupt brittle failure reduces strength. joint prepared dwell time le 10 s, Fe-Ti IMC thickness le 1 μm, lead higher shear strength (tensile) higher β-Ti thickness dwell time increases. joint prepared dwell time 10 s, relatively higher Fe-Ti IMC thickness reduces shear strength (tensile). EDS analysis fracture surface shear strength (tensile) test reveals dissimilar joint failed dissimilar interface containing Fe-Ti IMC.

IntroductionComposite structure Ti alloy SS wide range application aerospace, chemical, nuclear industry lower cost weight [1], [2]. However, direct fusion welding titanium alloy stainless steel readily produced large amount brittle Ti-based IMCs [3]. Ti-based IMCs highly brittle, deteriorating quality joint. Moreover, great difference thermal property Ti alloy SS caused occurrence residual stress [4], [5]. direct welding method yielded reliable strong Ti alloy/SS dissimilar joint. order prevent formation Ti-based IMCs, much effort undertaken research insert interlayer could modify final phase composition. Currently, laser welding Ti alloy stainless steel performed using additional interlayer Cu [6], Ag [7].

However, high cost, low yield strength, simplistic structure NiTi shape memory alloy (SMA) product restrict broader application [3, 4]. overcome limitations, combining NiTi material create multi-material system leverage beneficial property component. Stainless steel (SS), low cost, high specific strength, good machinability, biocompatibility, represents ideal candidate compensate NiTi’s drawbacks, especially fabricating complex component biomedical application [5]. Therefore, demand joining NiTi SS significant, achieving high-quality NiTi/SS joint become formidable challenge [6].At present, various welding process available joining NiTi SS, including spot welding [7, 8], Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) welding [9], electron beam welding [10], laser beam welding. Among these, laser welding commonly adopted process due advantage high energy density, narrow heat-affected zone (HAZ), minimal weld distortion. Although highly controllable heat source employed, laser welding NiTi SS still face serious challenge, namely formation hard brittle intermetallic compound (IMCs), particular Ti-Fe phases, difficult suppress NiTi SS similar melting point (NiTi: 1583 K, SS: ~1673 K) melting mixing usually unavoidable welded directly [11]. precipitation IMCs lead weld defect microcracks macrosegregation, adversely affecting performance NiTi/SS welded joint [12].To improve quality NiTi/SS welded structure, substantial research work carried based concept eliminating brittle intermetallic compound introducing intermediate filler material two base metals. C.H. et al. [13] applied high-melting-point metal Ta interlayer foil laser welding NiTi AISI 316L SS. identified presence Ta interlayer played role diffusion barrier NiTi SS, thus restricting formation Ti-Fe IMCs improving joint tensile strength. Filler material Cu [14], Co [15], Ni [16] also employed joining NiTi SS, respectively. Similar finding observed joint mechanical property enhanced extent changing weld chemical composition forming favorable intermetallic compound Ni3Ti γ phase, ductile Ti-Fe phases. However, common problem study amount filler material must strictly controlled, excessive addition lead formation harmful IMCs like Cr2Ta Ni3Ta Ta filler, Ti-Cu IMCs Cu filler, Ti-Co IMCs Co filler, turn deteriorate joint property [6]. Therefore, still necessary explore appropriate filler material improve NiTi/SS joint performance without generating harmful IMCs.High entropy alloy (HEA) recently attracted extensive attention due superior mechanical property [17]. HEA based multi-principal-component alloying system demonstrates high entropy, meaning element prefer distribute randomly lattice form solid solution rather complex phase IMCs [18,19,20]. Different challenging dissimilar metals, including aluminum alloy/steel [21], titanium/aluminum alloy [22], magnesium/aluminum alloy [23], SMA490BW steel/304 stainless steel [24], successfully joined using various HEAs filler materials. representative HEA, CoCrFeNiMn alloy, also known Cantor alloy, whose microstructure face-centered cubic (FCC) (Fe, Ni) solid solution, exhibit excellent combination high strength ductility. Wang et al. [25] used CoCrFeNiMn filler material joining NiTi/SS dissimilar alloys. revealed introduction CoCrFeMnNi significantly reduced formation Fe-Ti intermetallic compound enhanced (Fe, Ni) solid solution B2 phases, leading improved mechanical property NiTi/SS welded joint.Recent research shown direct correlation number alloying element mechanical property multi-principal-component alloy [26, 27]. derivative Cantor alloy like three-principal-component CoCrNi medium-entropy alloy (MEA) four-principal-component CoCrNiFe HEA reported present better combination strength ductility compared five-principal-component CoCrFeNiMn HEA, attributed solid solution strengthening caused severe local lattice distortion [28, 29]. finding indicates CoCrNi CoCrNiFe filler great potential joining NiTi SS dissimilar metals. However, relevant work reported, influence CoCrNi CoCrNiFe joining NiTi SS remains unclear.The present study aim explore effect CoCrNi MEA CoCrNiFe HEA microstructure mechanical property NiTi/SS welded joints.

IntroductionThe engineering profession benefit greatly additive manufacturing (AM) technology, enabling designer engineer create robust lighter item [1]. recently used variety industries, including related aircraft, automobiles, medical implants, structures, robots, lifestyle, sport [2,3]. employ special method build particular component layer layer employing Computer Aided Design (CAD) model input data 3D product output [4,5]. research focus WAAM technique classified Directed Energy Deposition (DED) technique classified Metal Additive Manufacturing (MAM) process [6]. WAAM process us electric arc heat source employ technique welding fabricate component instead laser [7,8]. WAAM, electric arc melt consumable wire continuously material get deposited layer layer form desired component. WAAM predominantly preferred high deposition rate 3–8 kg/h incredibly high compared powder-based system (0.1–0.6 kg/h) [9]. Thus, suitable manufacturing large-scale metal part simple geometry low technical cost compared conventional casting process [10]. WAAM process us technique Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) fabricate particular component. years, GMAW preferred improved material deposition capabilities, disposable electrode, lower costs, faster processing time [11]. Numerous obstacle problem related traditional GMAW WAAM procedure [12].The WAAM technique adversely affect mechanical property like strength ductility heat cycles. multi-pass welding procedures, Localised Brittle Zones (LBZ) Heat-Affected Zones (HAZ) occur along interface areas. thus necessary use low-heat-input metal transfer technology order lessen occurrence zone enhance manufactured product's mechanical microstructural qualities. material commonly employed WAAM process Titanium alloys, Aluminum alloys, Nickel alloy [13], Stainless steel carbon steels. Low carbon steel mostly preferred WAAM due low carbon content excellent welding ability compared medium high carbon steels. Hence, research, 304 austenitic SS chosen examine possible microstructures ferrite, bainite, martensite, etc, based carbon content, alloying elements, cooling rates.

Leilei Wang et al. investigate WAAM 316L stainless steel different arc modes, emphasizing process stability, structural integrity, microstructures, mechanical properties. result show SpeedPulse SpeedArc process stable, efficient, structurally sound. Despite similar deposition rate scanning speeds, SpeedArc WAAM exhibit lower heat input higher cooling rates, resulting finer solidification structure SpeedPulse WAAM. Moreover, emphasized component produced SpeedArc WAAM greater tensile strength hardness due characteristic [15]. Rodrigues et al. examine addition SiC particle molten pool WAAM high-strength low-alloy steel. introduction particles, high melting point, led grain refinement precipitation Fe3C due SiC dissociation. also found mechanical testing hardness profile enhanced mechanical strength SiC-added WAAM parts, attributed refined grain structure finely dispersed Fe3C [16].Rafieazad et al. [17] investigated microstructural mechanical property low-carbon low-alloy steel consistency localized mechanical property observed along building direction. ductility horizontal direction three time vertical direction fractured surface revealed substantial plastic deformation part along deposition direction compared building direction. CMT process advanced metal transfer short-circuit technique developed Fronius company [18]. special quality CMT deposit metal physically retracting wire, lower heat input around 30–40 % [19]. result, overall characteristic enhanced presence LBZ HAZ softening significantly reduced. Senthil et al. [20] investigated microstructural mechanical characterization functionally graded Inconel 825 - SS316L fabricated using CMT process delamination crack wall. Inconel 825 specimen presence continuous cellular-dendritic discontinuous cellular-dendritic microstructures, whereas SS316L composed 5 % delta ferrite austenite microstructures. Fractography displayed high plastic deformation, indicating ductile mode. Sun et al. examined microstructure mechanical property low-carbon, high-strength steel discovered longitudinal specimen's tensile strength le transverse specimen. also observed microhardness steel varied bottom top, whereas bottom part highest hardness value [21].The review literature supported necessity CMT-powered WAAM research focused establishing mechanical microstructural uniformity. Achieving uniformity cylindrical component particularly difficult since microstructures influenced low heat input printing precision. Hence, research focus attaining homogeneity mechanical microstructural property 304 austenitic stainless steel (SS) cylindrical component fabricated using CMT technology-based WAAM Process. XRD analysis performed examine phase different portion deposited wall also OM SEM analysis helped investigate dendrite formation predominant role mechanical tensile properties. Finally, order establish homogeneity deposited wall cylinder, hardness tensile test performed.2. Materials methods2.1.

CMT-WAAM part, nodule formation much le compared GMAW process based reference [31]. small scratch bump material called nodule formed one place component, shown Fig. 4(f). However, nodule formation avoided controlling process parameters. average wall thickness 8.2 ± 2 mm observed CMT-WAAM process. attainment reduced wall thickness compared process due low heat input restricts overlapping layer also form exact consistent path. Moreover, thermal dispersion uniform, tends improve homogeneity microstructure.

Among various fuel used steam power plant, coal one preferred fuel power generation around 40 per cent worldwide electricity produced coal-based power plants. Coal major source CO2 emission power generation sectors. therefore necessary monitor greenhouse gas emission order protect environment. regard, power generation low CO2 emission increased efficiency achieved replacing ultra-supercritical (USC) power plant advanced ultra-supercritical (AUSC) power plants. AUSC boiler operate higher steam parameter improve efficiency power plant reduced coal consumption le emission toxic gas environment [1]. order meet demand AUSC boiler steam conditions, new material continuously developed recently developed material follows: superalloys (Haynes 263, Haynes 282, 617, Inconel 740, etc.) advanced stainless steel (Super 304H, SS 304H, T92, etc.).Advanced austenitic steel superalloys main material suitable AUSC boiler withstand high temperature steam pressure. Advanced austenitic steel withstand temperature 625–650, nickel-based superalloys withstand temperature 700–750 [2]. Owing economical consideration, advanced austenitic steel used moderately high temperature, nickel-based superalloys used high-temperature location boiler components. SS 304H preferred superheater tubes, 617 preferred header portion boilers. Hence, necessary join two dissimilar material welding process. Welding play important role joining boiler materials. Among different welding process used fabrication boiler components, fusion welding process gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), submerged arc welding (SAW), shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) gas metal arc welding (GMAW) widely used [3].Inconel alloy austenitic stainless steel good mechanical properties, metallurgical stability corrosion resistance suitable AUSC steam operating temperature pressures. technical economic advantage joining two material using welding process. Joining two alloy tedious due difference chemical composition thermal coefficient. Therefore, important choose appropriate welding process parameter meet requirement boiler operations. Sahu et al. [4] investigated mechanical metallurgical behaviour dissimilar welding 718–316 using microplasma arc welding process without fillers. author reported weld zone dominated presence columnar dendrites. Segregations alloying element Nb Ti found maximum interdendritic region dendritic region resulted reduced hardness fusion zone base material 718. However, hardness value higher base material SS 316L. general, weld metal expected better mechanical property base metals, often achieved dissimilar welding due non-homogeneity base filler materials. regard, various researcher studied influence filler weld quality. Yahya Aghayar et al. [5] evaluated microstructure mechanical property dissimilar weld 601-SS 304H filler wire ER304. author compared property pulsed traditional GTAW. pulsed current GTAW process gave excellent mechanical property reduction heat input welding process. author recommended use ER304 filler wire meet requirement higher temperature boilers. Yu Zhang et al. [6] examined microstructure mechanical property TIG-welded SS 304H-IN 617 filler wire 617. TIG welding resulted full penetration, impact strength tensile strength dissimilar weld lower base metal owing formation non-homogenous microstructure fusion zone. Devendranath et al. [7] investigated effect various filler material ERNiCrMo-4, ERNiCrMo-10, ERNiCrMo-14 ERNiCu-7 pulsed current GTAW superaustenitic stainless steel. Among four filler wires, author observed better tensile impact property welding ERNiCrMo-14 filler wire. author found segregation Mo le welding Mo-rich ERNiCrMo-14 filler wire. order increase deposition welding process, researcher tried different configuration filler wires. Jung Hyun Park et al. [8] used novel C-type filler analyse effect weld bead geometry Super-TIG welding 625. author successfully increased deposition rate using Type C Filler.In addition filler wire selection, inherent nature welding process also play vital role controlling weld mechanical properties. Generally, welding process high cooling rate low melting area offer excellent mechanical properties. Kourdani et al. [9] compared SMAW GTAW welding procedure joining 625 316L stainless steel. author recommended GTAW ERNiCrMo-3 filler material achieve better mechanical properties. Pavan et al. [10] assessed dissimilar weld Super 304H–IN 617 using GTAW consumable filler wire 617. author observed presence unmixed zone Super 304H side partially mixed zone 617 side. tensile tested sample failed Super 304H heat-affected zone (HAZ) side. UTS weld lower 617 base metals, higher Super 304H. Boiler component usually made thick plates, thick plate difficult weld single welding pass. requires multipass deposit metal entire thickness, multipass welding result reduction mechanical property due uncontrolled heat input higher residual stress build-up. Ahmad et al. [11] investigated multipass dissimilar welding Inconel 617-Super 304H using direct current straight polarity (DCSP) tungsten inert gas (TIG). author observed irregular austenite grain 617 side fusion zone collapsed martensite steel side HAZ reduced mechanical properties. Tumer et al. [12] studied multipass dissimilar welding 625 UNS S32205 duplex stainless steel using MIG welding process ER2209 filler material. observed weld zone HAZ poor toughness due segregation Nb Mo, resulted formation small intermetallic precipitates.The quality weld mainly depends selection correct process combination welding parameters. Identifying process parameter material process take time economical trial-and-error method. One simplest easiest method identify right combination parameter application optimization techniques. date, researcher widely used multipurpose optimization technique GRA TOPSIS select best combination parameter manufacturing processes. GRA technique work based grey relational theory convert multiobjective function single objective calculating grey relation grade (GRG) [13]. TOPSIS also simple efficient multicriteria decision-making technique identification optimized parameter [14].Deepan et al. [15] successfully used GRA technique determine optimized welding parameter laser welding NiTinol shape memory alloy. Sivakumar et al. [16] used GRA TOPSIS optimize welding parameter activated flux tungsten inert gas welding (A-TIG). results, author concluded optimized GRA TOPSIS parameter outside L25 experimental trial. Similarly, Srinivasan et al. [17] used TOPSIS GRA identify optimum parameter GTA welding 15CDV6 aerospace materials. author found combination optimized parameter identified GRA TOPSIS totally different other.The literature show SS 304H 617 suitable material AUSC systems. Various researcher studied weldability joint similar dissimilar configuration different fusion welding process TIG, MIG SMAW. major problem related dissimilar welding 617-SS 304H presence lack sidewall fusion; multipasses required join thick plate reduction impact strength tensile properties. Hence, work, attempt made overcome problem using double-pulse MIG welding process. addition, tried apply multiobjective optimization technique TOPSIS GRA identify optimized combination parameters. metallurgical characterization weld discussed mean microstructures obtained optical microscope high-resolution scanning electron microscope (HRSEM). elemental variation weld also discussed using energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS).2 Materials Methods5-mm-thick plate 617 SS 304H welded butt joint configuration using double-pulse MIG welding process.

IntroductionHigh-performance stainless steel applied industrial structural materials, aerospace marine engineering equipment, due superior corrosion resistance, high strength, good toughness [[1], [2], [3]]. However, traditional stainless steel challenging meet increasing application need industrial equipment high-performance materials, lightweight, low cost, optimization mechanical properties. Developing new idea promote serviceability stainless steel industrial field necessary. study shown regulation microstructure improve mechanical property steel based structural characteristic steel, bimodal grain design [4,5], twinning-induced plasticity [6,7], transformation-induced plasticity effect [1,8]. addition, development laminated metal composite (LMCs) also provides new insight improving application prospect traditional steels.LMCs obtained metallurgical combination various metal integrate superior property constituent metals. provides feasible opportunity promote industrial application single steel Ti/Steel [9,10], Steel/Steel [11,12], Al/Steel [[13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]], Ni/Steel [19], Cu/Steel [20]. Among these, Al/Steel composite great potential industrial structural material due advantage low density, good formability, mechanical property aluminum alloy constituent metal. Various method applied prepare Al/Steel LMCs, friction stir welding [14], resistance spot welding [21,22], rolling bonding [16,23,24], explosive bonding [15]. general, rolling bonding methods, especially cast-rolling bonding, considered promising fabrication method LMCs due simple processing condition mass-production capacity large sheet compared technologies. However, noting worth although excellent bonding ability achieved, as-cast structural characteristic introduced cast-rolling process determine property cast-rolled LMCs generally lower traditional deformation method, especially strength properties.In order optimize mechanical property Al/Steel LMCs cast-rolling, several problem need addressed based structural characteristic cast-rolled composites. one hand, according binary phase diagram aluminum steel, Al–Fe intermetallic compound appear preparation majority Al/Steel LMCs hot forming, affecting interfacial bonding ability LMCs [16,25]. certain interfacial bonding ability one key factor affecting mechanical property multilayered material crack initiation propagation mechanism plastic deformation [26,27]. Undoubtedly, effective control thickness distribution intermetallic compound layer interface breakthrough point improve mechanical property as-cast Al/Steel LMCs. hand, microstructure constituent layer play major role evolution mechanical property Al/Steel LMC. structural characteristic as-cast constituent layer cast-rolling bonding (e.g., coarse grain casting defects) different deformed metal, determines mechanical property cast-rolled Al/Steel LMCs great prospect optimization. Therefore, necessary regulate interlaminar internal microstructures composite order improve mechanical property application ability cast-rolled Al/Steel LMC.In general, multilayered composite considered promising structure due existence multiple interface heterogeneous components, provide new insight optimization microstructure mechanical property cast-rolled composite. Therein, interface effect introduced incompatible deformation dissimilar metal LMCs proved effectively promote occurrence shear strain, contributing considerable deformation constituent layer [28]. Also, worth mentioning increase deformation degree also positive effect control formed intermetallic compound interface, resulting fragmentation discrete distribution intermetallics [29]. hand, reinforcement configuration related microstructural distribution (e.g., bimodal structure [30], gradient structure [31] heterogeneous structure [32]) thought provide additional strengthening mechanism resulting mechanical incompatibility dissimilar phases. reported constituent characteristic different flow property contributed improvement strength toughness LMCs plastic deformation, mainly due formation strain gradient caused geometrically necessary dislocation (GNDs) [[32], [33], [34]]. provides another strengthening idea Al/Steel composites, revealing reasonable constituent collocation microstructure control effectively promote optimization properties. According analysis, addition new constituent layer basis bi-metallic cast-rolled Al/Steel composite considered effective method strengthen composite regulation interlaminar internal microstructures simultaneously.In present work, combined bonding method roll-casting rolling bonding applied produce tri-metallic Al/Al/Steel composites. re-bonding 7075Al 1060Al/Steel aim realize optimization comprehensive performance. addition, GNDs strain evolution constituent layer plastic deformation observed study influence deformation behavior mechanical property LMCs. present investigation provides new insight structural design high-performance Al/Steel LMC.2.

IntroductionFor demand lightweight metal structural part automobile spaceflight system, joining aluminum steel gained prospect [1,2]. enormous difference physical-chemical property aluminum steel, main problem joining two metal formation brittle IMCs, would reduce mechanical property joint [3,4]. fact, solve problem, nearly welding process tried, friction stir welding [5], explosive welding [6], diffusion bonding [7], vacuum brazing [8], fusion welding-brazing [9], etc. Researchers illustrated fusion welding-brazing methods, suitable various welding joint types, easy operated automatically control growth brittle compounds, adaptive way join dissimilar metal [10]. Aluminum alloy stainless steel connected TIG welding-brazing method, phase composition IMC layer joint mainly Fe2Al5. tensile strength 105 MPa obtained fracture occurred IMC layer [11]. Fe2Al5 phase also discovered interface laser welding-brazing joint aluminum alloy stainless steel. detrimental mechanical property joint, maximum tensile strength 90 MPa [12]. order improve bonding strength interface, Song added Si element filler wire TIG welding-brazing. IMC layer interface became Al8Fe2Si compound. consequence, tensile strength joint increased 122 MPa [11]. kind filler wire containing Si element also used laser welding-brazing aluminum alloy stainless steel. tensile strength reached 120 MPa formation Al8Fe2Si phase IMC layer [12]. Since difficult Al form continuous solid solution elements, Al base filler metal used, mentioned above, Si element added. Thus, AlSi5 filler metal used quite experiments.Nevertheless, fusion welding-brazing seam produced arc laser heat source prone oxidation poor protection gas shielded atmosphere [13,14]. necessary add flux remove oxide film base metal surface. method bring flux residual welds. Due excellent vacuum protection atmosphere, well low heat-input, rapid cooling rate high energy density, electron beam welding (EBW) considered suitable method welding dissimilar metal joint [15,16].In study, vacuum electron beam welding-brazing pure aluminum stainless steel without flux using AlSi5 filler wire conducted. Meanwhile, similar experiment without filler wire also carried regarded controlled trail. interface structure dissimilar metal two joint discussed. tensile strength associated nanohardnesses Young’ modulus interface layer detected. Furthermore, regulating mechanism interfacial morphology deduced.2.

Table 3 present nanohardness (HN), Young’s modulus (E), maximum displacement (hmax) final depth (hf) indentation Al8Fe2Si Fe2Al5 IMC layers, respectively. Apparently, nanohardness Young’s modulus Al8Fe2Si IMC layer lower Fe2Al5 IMC layer. could explained Ref [11], proposed supersaturated solid solution Si element Fe-Al compound would decrease hardness IMC. Moreover, Young’s modulus CP-Al 70.3 GPa room temperature nanohardness 0.5 GPa mentioned Ref [20,21]. well known lower Young’s modulus, higher plasticity. reduction nanohardness would reduce possibility brittle fracture.

One preferred method welding steel gas-tungsten arc welding (GTAW), offer numerous benefit welding processes, better control heat input, le spatter, minimum distortion [3]. spite advantages, mechanical characteristic weldment majorly affected heat input, microstructure, solidification behavior weld metal GTAW [4, 5]. generally known equilibrium solidification, microstructure 304SS primarily constituted austenite (γ-Fe). However, nonequilibrium rapid solidification situation, faster cooling rate result partial δ-γ transformation, minimum quantity metastable δ-ferrite (δ-Fe) inevitably retained [2]. Also, weld metal solidification structure ASS dendritic, considerable quantity elemental segregation; cause significant loss weld metal mechanical property compared base metal [6]. attain improved mechanical properties, amount δ-Fe produced welding must regulated. precipitation δ-Fe mostly determined composition weld pool rate cooling solidification. solidification mode play major role, Creq/Nieq ratio fall within 1.52–1.9 range. higher heat inputs, cooling rate relatively slow leading formation coarser grain amount δ-Fe also increase along increase dendrite thickness. lower heat inputs, finer grain formed, resulting partial penetration [5].Extensive research focused new hybrid welding process attempt enhance mechanical metallurgical property weldment amount heat input, either grain refining, altering ferrite volume, providing external magnetic field. Various technique application electromagnetic vibration GTAW enhance majority columnar dendritic fragmentation, growth fine equiaxed dendrites, reduction amount δ-Fe weld metal [7]. change mode power supply continuous pulsed mode increased metallurgical property reducing δ-Fe [8]. Narrow heat-affected zone (HAZ) improved tensile strength achieved keyhole tungsten arc welding [9]. Interaction magnetic field GTAW resulted periodic change arc profile, equiaxed grain refined microstructure observed SS 304 weldment [10]. Among techniques, application additional magnetic field welding result constriction arc, stirring molten metal weld pool, increase arc energy density amount heat input. inducing additional magnetic field, density electron within plasma increase compared without magnetic field [11]. Furthermore, claimed magnetic field influence atom diffusion materials, resulting phase alteration, grain development, recrystallization [12]. Several study carried different arrangement magnetic field understand effect shape arc plasma. electromagnet permanent magnet used acquire desired magnetic field configuration [13]. Compared electromagnet, permanent magnet compatible consumes power le space [13,14,15,16]. Various configuration magnetic field developed classified longitudinal magnetic field (LMF) [17], axial magnetic field (AMF) [15, 16], transverse magnetic field (TMF) [18, 19], cusp-type magnetic field (CMF) [14]. arc rotates AMF enhance stiffness stability arc plasma due action Lorentz force. effect AMF substantial restricted plasma arc. increase quality weld surface, LMF TMF applied. Humps undercut eliminated high-speed GMAW using TMF.In application CMF GTAW, arc constrained turned oval shape turn increased weld bead aspect ratio, improving weld appearance weld speed [7, 13]. CMF arrangement major impact welding arc plasma property weld quality. influence external AMF 304SS weldment laser-metal inert gas hybrid welding investigated Chen et al. [20]. Distribution arc pressure workpiece relatively uniform influence magnetic field [21]. use appropriate magnetic field enhanced grain refinement tensile strength 12% reduced tensile residual stresses. EMF used welding, cause electromagnetic agitation molten metal, resulting grain refining weld metal solidification. austenitic 304SS, also change kinetics phase precipitation HAZ [22]. Stirring effect produced AMF resulted decrement thermal gradient promoted uniform skeletal ferrite decreased intensity ferrite texture [23]. increase resistance pitting corrosion also observed [24]. Grain refinement ferrite reduction aided optimum magnetic field intensity, boosted impact toughness laser-MIG hybrid weld SS 304 [25]. ideal real-time application, considering contactless nature magnetic field exertion electric current welding exceptionally tidy. Furthermore, controlling arrangement magnetic field electric current advanced rapidly recent years. use external magnetic field welding shown cost-effective efficient way improve quality welding process.The aim research determine effect CMF configuration weld quality 304SS GTAW.

IntroductionAustenitic stainless steel (ASSs) used extensively variety industrial sector like chemical, pharmaceuticals, textile food processing industry (Ref 1). Austenitic stainless steel account approximately 60% world production among stainless steels, high corrosion resistance moderate environment (Ref 2), due self-healing passive film formation character (Cr2O3). Austenitic stainless steel categorized two groups, known 300 series ASSs 200 series ASSs. AISI 304 SS popular grade 300 series, containing 18% Cr 8% Ni. primary importance Ni SS due ability to: (I) stabilize austenitic structure room temperature (II) enlarge gamma field Fe-Cr-Ni ternary phase diagram elevated temperature range (Ref 3). Due growing price nickel, low-nickel nickel-free SS, i.e., 200 series SS, evoked great attention recently (Ref 4, 5). grade reduced consumption nickel replacing Ni addition manganese (Mn) austenite stabilizer (Ref 6, 7).Shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) commonly used welding practice many industry joining metal (Ref 8,9,10). Microstructure, mechanical corrosion property weld depend upon solidification mode. Galvis et al. worked characterization failure mode different welding process 304 SS reported SMAW, gas metal arc welding (GMAW) flux core arc welding (FCAW) minimum influence mechanical property except mean grain size heat-affected zone (HAZ) (Ref 11). also reported SMAW provides better toughness HAZ compared GMAW (Ref 12). Taiwade et al. reported formation carbide precipitate grain coarsening 304 SS increasing number weld pass (Ref 13). solidification, incomplete transformation ferrite austenite. Hence, room temperature untransformed ferrite, known δ ferrite. reported higher heat input, concomitant increase decrease δ-ferrite depending upon solidification behavior weld pool. However, δ-ferrite play vital role mechanical corrosion property weld zone. Yan et al. reported microstructure joint 304 SS composed δ-ferrite γ-austenite phase (Ref 14). Investigation performed Subodh et al. effect heat input microstructure mechanical property gas tungsten arc welded (GTAW) 304 SS joint reported heat input effect dendritic size (Ref 15). Dendrite size fusion zone small low heat input (LHI) medium heat input (MHI) high heat input (HHI); moreover, high tensile strength reported LHI sample (Ref 15). role δ ferrite immense effect pitting corrosion behavior ASSs (Ref 15). delta ferrite weld zone result better pitting corrosion resistance (Ref 15). Hence, heat input affect solidification mode ferrite content weld, play important role microstructural mechanical corrosion property steel. However, investigation undertaken Ref 15 verified case SMAW. best author’s knowledge, Cr-Mn steel specifically investigated context. Therefore, becomes interesting conduct comparative study dendritic size inter-dendritic spacing variation type stainless steel grades. avoid welding defect better corrosion resistance, careful selection welding electrode crucial. However, E-308 electrode recommended welding ASSs, due low cost easy availability (Ref 16). Therefore, present study, SMAW Cr-Mn SS 304 SS conducted using E 308 electrode different heat inputs. Also, microstructure property correlation established taking account influence welding heat input phase composition influence corrosion behavior different stainless steel grades.Materials MethodsThe base material used investigation Cr-Mn SS (low-nickel SS) 304 SS as-rolled condition.

Among hard materials, Austenitic steel popular choice various application consumed around 72 % worldwide due anti-corrosion, high-temperature strength, low strength-to-weight ratio, high durability, easy fabrication property [2]. Compared materials, low-carbon steels, austenitic stainless steel thought “difficult-to-cut” materials. Tendency produce long, sticky, stringy chip along built-up edge formation common characteristic it. may result shorter tool life poor surface finish [3], [4]. characteristic make austenitic stainless steel difficult-to-cut material rapid work-harden tendency; low thermal conductivity; high affinity machining tool material.The tool life cutting material mainly governed extensive property tool. property enhanced CVD PVD coating techniques. dry ecological machining many researcher company focusing PVD coatings. TiN chromium nitride (CrN) effectively employed cuttin tool dy [5]. CrN superior TiN term corrosion, frition, wear resistance, toughness, according Kawate et al. [6]. According Ding et al. [7], TiN CrN maximum oxidation resistance 500 °C 600 °C respectively. Barshilia et al. [8] stated cutting process hard coating tool exposed high temperature sustained coating whose thermal stability excellent. Different alloying element Si, Ti, B, Al, C added binary (TiN CrN) coating improve it. (Ti, Al)N coating well-known ternary coating go name TiAlN AlTiN, depending much Al present. coating show high abrasive wear resistance thermal stability also high due formation stable Al2O3 oxide layer [9], [10]. Several researcher reported state (Ti, Al) N-based coating made using cathodic arc (PVD) sputtering techniques. result high hot hardness, chemical inertness, low heat conductivity, (Ti, Al)N coating well suited dry machining diverse alloy high speed [11], [12].Mo Zhu [13] investigated thermal property AlCrN ternary coating. Several experiment conducted investigate thermal, tribological, mechanical properties. Properties AlCrN coating also compared TiAlN AlTiN coating coating deposited using CAE technique. reported AlCrN coating thermally stable 1000 °C whereas TiAlN AlTiN could stable 800 °C 900 °C. Kalss [14] investigated thermal property AlTiN TiAlN coating deposited using CAE technique uncoated cemented carbide insert. thermal conductivity uncoated insert 80 W/m K. depositing AlTiN TiAlN coating, thermal conductivity observed drastically reduced coated tools. Moreover, observed thermal conductivity AlTiN TiAlN coating increase temperature.Chinchanikar et al. [15] used CVD-applied multi-layer TiCN/Al2O3/TiN coated carbide insert process AISI 4340 steel hardened two distinct hardness levels, 35 45 HRC, respectively.Wagh et al. [16] investigated performance AISI 304 steel using AlCrN/TiAlN tools. observed temprarure tool-chip junction rise increasing cutting speed, due coating's limited heat conductivity, well workpeice tool.Kulkarni et al.

Cutting temperature variation (a) cutting speed (constant feed: 0.2 mm/rev) (b) feed (constant speed: 200 m/min) constant depth cut 1 mm.Fig. 5 illustrates closely cutting temperature cutting speed related. Additionally, found temperature rise cutting speed increases. Shear energy frictional energy two main division specific energy. Direct relationship exist shear energy frictional energy well shear velocity chip velocity [1]. Therefore, increase cutting speed directly corresponds increase energy consequently temperature.Additionally, clear Fig. 5(a) (b) coating structure significantly affect cutting temperature. Temperature increase monotonically coated tool TB, ranging 780 °C 942 °C, varies uncoated tool TA, ranging 704 °C 881 °C.A relatively low cutting temperature observed using TA TB mainly due two reasons. Firstly, fact thermal conductivity different tool work material different. uncoated tool (TA), TiAlN coated tool (TB), SS 304 steel thermal conductivity 80 W /mK, 6.7 W/mK, 16.7 W /m K, respectively [5], [20].The TA higher thermal conductivity TB. Even though thermal conductivity increase temperature, coated tool's thermal conductivity high temperature stay lower untreated tool's [5]. Therefore, heat conducted tool machining TA compared TB. Hence, temperature TA le TB. result matching well reported W. Grzesik [21].Secondly, TA wear rapidly compared TB. this, cutting parameters, contact area TA increase hence result conduction heat tool area. Whereas, case TB, higher wear resistance wear easily. Consequently, little growth contact area. also discovered heat produced TB transferred chip, advantageous preserving tool's superior thermal stability high temperatures. However, high heat conductivity TA primary factor inducing decrease hot hardness, lead tool failing early [22].The lower thermal conductivity TB generated high cutting temperature TA also help enhancing performance. heat generated using tool increase temperature work-tool contact region make work material comparatively soft. (Tensile strength SS 304 room temperate 520 MPa whereas temperature 650 °C 330 MPa [23]). Hence cutting force required removing material reduces eventually protects tool excessive wear. also observed TA show least temperature temperature gradient higher compared TB. However, TB near temperature gradient.The figure clearly show average tool-chip contact temperature rise feed increases. feed increased maintaining constant cutting speed, material removal rate likewise rises. quantity energy needed shearing likewise increase MRR rises, cause heat develop raise cutting temperature. result, cutting temperature rise input increases.4. ConclusionIt concluded relationship cutting temperature cutting speed strong. Due increase total energy, rise cutting speed rises. cutting tool's heat conductivity also role. increase decrease thermal conductivity. rise thermal conductivity falls. tool coated (TA) lowest cutting temperature. primarily caused tool's strong thermal conductivity extensive wear-out region, quickly transferred heat uncoated tool decreased cutting temperature. Additionally, discovered coating structure significantly affect cutting temperature region 10–12 %. Due limited heat conductivity TB tool coating, TB cutting temperature grows monotonically, demonstrating increased cutting temperature. However, multilayer coated tool excellent heat stability. result, performed better.CRediT authorship contribution statementAtul Kulkarni: Methodology, Conceptualization, Resources, Investigation, Validation, Writing – original draft.

IntroductionIn recent years, rapid development petrochemical industries, requirement high-performance pressure vessel getting higher harsh service environment strong corrosiveness, high temperature, high pressure, etc. [1], [2], [3]. However, residual stress introduced manufacturing, deteriorates mechanical properties, strain strengthening one common way eliminating adverse effects. strain strengthening, introduced prior plastic deformation relieve internal stress enhance strength steel effectively, helpful lightweight construction [4], [5].304 austenite stainless steel (SS) widely used pressure vessel excellent mechanical property high corrosion resistance. austenite stainless steels, two way strain strengthening consisting pre-deformation ambient temperature cryogenic-temperature. strengthening effect account following two reasons. one hand, part austenite transformed strain-induced martensite high strength plastic deformation, pinning effect dislocation motion [6]; hand, plastic deformation lead dislocation multiplication enhancement strength dislocation strengthening [7]. However, 304 SS susceptible stress corrosion cracking (SCC) sulfide stress corrosion cracking (SSCC) petrochemical environment H2S Cl- [8], [9], [10], prior plastic deformation cause higher susceptibility SCC SSCC based Gutman’s mechano-electrochemical theory [11]. Therefore, urgent ass SCC behavior 304 SS pre-strain study mechanism mitigating SCC. Cui et al. [12] found plastic deformation accelerates SCC enhancing anodic dissolution (AD) hydrogen embrittlement (HE) attributed increasing density dislocation, act active site electrochemical process. David’s work [13] also presented similar results, demonstrated increasing pre-strain induces emergence slip step therefore decrease electron work function corrosion rate. metastable austenite stainless steel 304 SS, well known pre-strain induces strain-induced martensite formation, role SCC much debated. Chang et al. [14] suggested strain induced martensite decline SCC susceptibility martensite provide galvanic protection mitigates SCC. Que et al. [15] found strain induced martensite form aggregate vicinity crack tip, enhances crack propagation. Schoell et al. [16] suggested strain induced martensite play major role SCC initiation. sum up, research concentrated effect ambient pre-strain SCC, SCC 304 SS cryogenic pre-strain rarely investigated.

Besides, transformation austenite ε α' martensite facilitated. Therefore, amount crystal defect higher, partial martensite transformation occurs earlier cryogenic pre-strained specimens. meantime, number nucleation site different grain high, enhances ability continue phase transformation, make strain induced martensite transformation occur uniformly stably [42].4.2.

According local additional potential model (LAPM) previous work [46], [47], site electrochemically active state, accelerates SCC initiation propagation. particular, interface austenite martensite play crucial role. interface accommodate mismatch two phases, exist higher localized strain dislocation density, enhances localized hydrogen concentration electrochemical activity [48]. Therefore, hydrogen enhanced localized plasticity (HELP) hydrogen enhanced decohesion (HEDE) take place, lead crack initiation propagation along martensite lath, shown Fig. 11(a). Besides, hydrogen presence facilitate strain-induced martensite transformation [49], enhances risks. word, SCC accelerated attributed combined effect electrochemistry, stress hydrogen, mixed control AD HE.As two different pre-strain conditions, corrosion resistance SCC resistance specimen pre-strained cryogenic temperature slightly higher indicated Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8, Fig. 9. due microstructural difference mentioned Section 4.1. Also, shown EBSD result Fig. 15, martensite deformation band distribute inhomogeneously specimen pre-strained room temperature, occur uniformly specimen pre-strained cryogenic temperature, corresponds discussion Section 4.1. Concerning galvanic effect, inhomogeneously distributed martensite band act anode accelerate localized AD inside along boundaries. Besides, inhomogeneous martensite facilitates heterogeneous distribution hydrogen, result localized hydrogen pressure stress concentration. Therefore, synergy AD promoted. uniformly distributed martensite band specimen pre-strained cryogenic temperature, role localized AD limited initiation early stage SCC. Therefore, cryogenic temperature strain strengthening superior ambient temperature strain strengthening SCC resistance.5.

Addition austenite stabilizing element like nickel, manganese nitrogen develops austenite, face cubic crystalline structure ferrite. Also, specific composition, heat treatment cooling rate needed formation [1]. nonmagnetic, work hardenable austenitic steel widely used diversified application automotive, aerospace, chemical, food, dairy, medical, home architectural industry owing formability, ductility, toughness, weldability, corrosion creep resistance [2, 3]. general, application stainless steel diversified area requires joining standard structural shape one welding technique [4]. SS304 weldable arc welding technique also new technique like friction stir welding, cold metal transfer welding, etc. Friction stir welding capable produce high quality consistent, light similar dissimilar weld superior microstructure, mechanical, fatigue corrosion behavior [5,6,7].Tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding utilizes non-consumable tungsten electrode produce arc melting joining metals. TIG utilizes low-cost equipment produce high quality weld inert shielding gas like argon, helium, mixture prevent air metal reactions. Though, TIG offer many advantage low penetration depth (maximum 3.5 mm single pass) render le appropriate welding thick plate [8]. Joining thick plate (thickness greater 3.5 mm) using TIG welding necessitates preparation suitable groove geometry, multiple-pass welding, filler material [9,10,11,12,13,14]. Multi-pass welding overcomes limitation low penetration depth single pas TIG late used joining thick sections. However, result reduced productivity increased welding cost account expense edge preparation, increased cost filler metals, shielding gas labor cost.Other technique improve penetration TIG welding include optimization process parameter use oxide, fluoride, chloride-based fluxes, known activated fluxes. cases, oxide-based flux offer deepest penetration, improved microstructural, mechanical properties. Type activated flux used varies metal metal, example, SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, MnO2 flux preferred joining austenitic, duplex, martensitic stainless steel [15,16,17]. use activated flux along optimized parameter enhance penetration depth greatest achievable level.Optimization process parameter crucial success welding process affect quality property weldments. Welding current, speed, gas flow rate, arc gap process parameter significant consequence heat input however, affect weld heat input differently weld morphology quality [6, 18,19,20,21]. general, increase welding current, increase melting rate base metal due increased heat input turn result greater weld pool size, thus increased bead dimension [22,23,24]. Similar effect also observed decreasing welding speed i.e., increased penetration depth since weld arc spends time location raise temperature. Decrease welding speed 71.94 60.58 mm/min increase current 100 300 A, increased depth penetration 6.3 mm 6.7 mm welding 10 mm thick P-22 grade steel [25]. Arc gap also affect weld penetration. arc gap small, greater chance tungsten contamination lead inconsistent weld penetration cause shallow weld [26]. hand, large arc gap cause unstable erratic welding arc cause inconsistent weld penetration. cause deep narrow weld, provide sufficient strength weld [27, 28]. Welding speed current found influencing process parameter controlling hardness HAZ tensile strength TIG dissimilar weld AA6061-AA5083 aluminum alloy use non-optimal process parameter resulted larger HAZ, porosity, voids, defect larger number [20]. Greater gas flow prevents molten metal adverse outcome atmospheric gas increase penetration. increasing gas flow 1 18 l/min, weld width increased 5.42 mm 9.12 mm higher rate heat diffusion [29, 30]. Experiments planned per Taguchi L9 orthogonal array welding 4.84 mm thick SS304. Optimal parameter (110 current, 82 mm/min speed, 13 l/min flow rate) produce superior HAZ hardness 194 Hv possibly due ferrite content owing rapid cooling rate low heat input. High heat input resulted lower hardness slow cooling transformed majority ferrite low hardness austenite [31].In view literature review present work aim optimize process parameter viz. welding current, speed, gas flow rate arc gap using Taguchi L9 orthogonal array investigate influence weld morphology, microstructure, hardness using analysis variance (ANOVA).2 Experimental procedureSS304 plate dimension 100 mm \(\times \) 30 mm \(\times \) 6 mm used base metal.

Slower cooling facilitates owing higher peak temperature longer duration narrow region. also affect weld pool’s surface tension, decrease increasing temperature. Weld pool centre lower surface tension surrounding outer region owing higher temperature. Molten metal flow low surface tension region high surface tension region, i.e., weld center outer region. outward flow widens weld bead make shallow, case low current high speed cooling rate low. Arc gap arc length governs speed electrons. Short arc gap, low speed electron resulting le weld pool heating account le bombing effect electron turn produce shallow weld. lower penetration due decreased efficiency welding heat transfer arising enlarged anode diameter account higher heat generation [36]. increase helium gas flow rate 5 l/min 9 l/min increased penetration slightly due enhanced compression effect, i.e., arc constriction. higher flow rate, small amount helium escape air, large amount gas around arc enhances compression effect, causing heat transfer weld; hence, increased penetration depth obvious. summary, stronger inward flow pattern responsible bead narrower width deeper penetration due higher heat input.

Higher heat input, lower cooling rate, decrease weld bead hardness coarsening low volume delta ferrite. Wichan et al. [25] Bansod et al. reported similar result [39]. High speed welding low nickel austenitic stainless steel increase weld hardness. attributed faster weld cooling owing high speed, forming microstructure finer grain significant volume delta-ferrite. Increased gas flow rate beyond medium level believed increase cooling rate hardness. Similarly, increase hardness increase arc gap medium level due faster cooling rate due low heat input. decrease hardness increase arc gap beyond medium level may due lower cooling rate owing excessive heat input. optimum value process factor maximum bead hardness current 85 A, speed 3.5 mm/s, gas flow rate 13 l/min, arc gap 2 mm, evident Fig. 7.Current speed almost similar percentage contribution 48.60% 45.30%, respectively; thus, statistically significant, two factors, arc gap gas flow rate, low percentage contribution.

Additive manufacturing LMCs potential achieve desired microstructure, properties, structure. study, TA2–304 SS LMC, extensively employed pipe flange nuclear plant bow sonar dome, well fabricated utilizing directed energy deposition-arc (DED-arc) copper‑nickel alloy transition interlayers, formation brittle TiFe IMCs suppressed. result study indicated standard deviation height surface morphology reconstructed adopting Python VTK technique evaluated 0.67. Furthermore, copper‑nickel transition interlayer possessed capability isolating Ti Fe atom formation laminar-distributed microstructure. Specifically, Interlayer1 comprised (Fe, Cr) grain different shape small-size (Cu) equiaxial grains, Interlayer2 covered large-size (Cu, Ni) dendritic grain intergranular (Cu), TA2 layer comprised α-Ti Ti2Cu. result also showed thermal cycle-induced recovery recrystallization diffusion-induced elemental interaction accounted different microstructures. Moreover, interface TA2 Interlayer2 layer contained TiCu4 + (Cu), Ti3Cu4 + TiCu4, Ti2Cu + TiCu, TiCu + Ti2Cu eutectoid microstructures, resulted highest hardness 450Hv well crack initiation extension. Furthermore, due uniform-distribution microstructure absence brittle IMCs, average shear strength 234.0 MPa, reached strength conventional method conformed standard requirements.

IntroductionTitanium-steel laminated metal composite (LMCs), i.e., titanium-steel cladding plate, aroused rising attention exceptional combination high specific strength, excellent corrosion resistance, favorable sound conductivity, well low cost [[1], [2], [3]]. Accordingly, titanium-steel LMCs recognized highly promising structural component transition joint flange petrochemical industry, fuel storage nuclear power plants, heat exchanger seawater desalination, marine bulbous bow [[4], [5], [6], [7], [8]]. Due formation brittle TiFe TiFe2 (700 HV 1200 HV, respectively) intermetallic compound (IMCs), spontaneous fracture unavoidable fusion welding [9,10] conventional manufacturing method limited range solid- semisolid-bonding method (e.g., hot rolling method, hot stamping method, explosive welding) [11]. Thus, based previous studies, method eliminate brittle IMCs enhance bonding strength classified chemical alloying method physical isolation methods.For chemical alloying method, alloying element inhibit formation Ti-based IMCs forming solid solution le brittle IMCs. one hand, five element (i.e., Hf, Nb, Ta, V, Zr) dissolve Ti Fe atom simultaneously although solid solution good plasticity preferred. uncommon element mentioned posse extremely high melting points, increase amount base metal melted cost business. Thus, pure V [12,13] Nb [14,15] investigated based comprehensive considerations. help solid solution formation, V favor appearance σ phase, Nb facilitate formation (Nb, Ti) solid solution interface, maximum strength 396 MPa obtained hot rolling temperature 900 °C [16]. Moreover, Zr-alloy sheet used transition metal owing high affinity Zr element, whereas actual interfacial microstructure contains solid solution serval type IMCs due complex reaction multi-elements [17]. Although mechanical property acceptable, character high melting point limit choose manufacturing method high cost restrict application practice. hand, since stringent requirement raised solid solution formation, suitable element (e.g., Ag [18], Cu [18], Fe [19,20], Ni [21,22]) employed form le brittle IMCs. However, Ti atom cannot consumed fully due elemental diffusion thin transition metal layer.Accordingly, physical isolation method introduced prevent diffusion element isolate Ti atom Fe atom lowering reaction temperature shortening reaction time. Hot roll bonding hot stamping method produce thin broad cladding material uniform microstructure mechanical property [19], whereas elemental diffusion brittle IMCs formation remain difficult suppress due high manufacturing temperature long holding time high temperatures. shorten reaction time, explosive welding method used quick bonding process instantaneous high temperature [8,23]. Discontinuous distributed TiFe IMCs found titanium/steel interface, maximum shear strength obtained nearly 500 MPa. However, application limited high cost energy economics since specimen shape restricted manufacturing devices.Recent study focused additive manufacturing (AM) fabricating LMCs, chemical alloying method physical isolation method combined. Based metallurgical reaction melting pool, Cu powder served transition metals, whereas small melting pool size difficulty limiting diffusion atoms, result considerable brittle IMCs [24]. V Nb powder used interlayer isolate Ti Fe atom forming solid solution tensile strength sample 500 MPa [13,15,25]. Nevertheless, increasing cost may restrict application. Thus, low-cost powder V, Cr, Fe, 316SS deposited turns, hard brittle phase slightly formed laser directed energy deposition (DED) procedure based research NASA Rangley research center [26]. solid solution including (Fe, Ni), (Fe, Cr), (Fe, V), (V, Cr) (Ti, V) found sample max harness 425.3 Hv. Furthermore, composite metal powder laminar gradual changing composition (e.g., V + Ti64 [27], 316SS/V + V/Ti64 [28], Inconel 718 + Ti64 [29], Inconel 625 + 304SS [30]) deposited, TiFe IMCs removed effect exerted metallurgical reaction enlarged diffusion distance. However, low density high porosity as-fabricated sample main factor prepare post-heat treatment hot isostatic pressing fabrication, increase fabricating cost significantly.Compared DED, wire-arc additive manufacturing (WAAM), i.e., directed energy deposition-arc (DED-arc), recognized potential manufacturing method LMCs high flexibility low cost. Wu et al. proposed interweaving deposition strategy fabricating steel‑nickel composite material [31], whereas element combination cannot prevented due mix steel nickel melting pool. overcome combination elements, Chen et al. obtained titanium-steel gradient materials, similar titanium-steel LMC, regulating wire feeding speed titanium steel welding wires. Cracks occur atom fraction Fe atom reach 50%, indicated TiFe IMCs formed transition zone, chemical alloying take critical significance melting pool [32]. Thus, chemical alloying physical isolation essential based present case LMC fabrication.Meanwhile, previous study welding-brazing Ti steel well suppressed IMC using copper‑nickel alloy wire pre-set V-shape groove. reason presence Ni atom combine Fe Cu atom solid solution stainless-steel side, also combine Ti atom Cu-Ni-Ti IMCs low Gibbs free energy titanium alloy side. Thus, Ti Fe atom consumed Ni atoms. Meanwhile, copper matrix enlarge diffusion distance TiFe IMCs removed completely chemical alloying physical isolation [11,33,34], indicating low-cost copper‑nickel alloy wire potential material fabricate titanium-steel LMC.In general, titanium-steel LMC fabricated employing DED-arc, copper‑nickel alloy wire supposed. aim implementing chemical alloying physical isolation, two copper‑nickel alloy interlayer one pure titanium layer deposited sequence study, feasibility fabricating titanium-steel LMC DED-arc verified. Since surface flatness act vital factor depositing metals, superficial morphology reconstructed quantized contribute process parameter optimization. Further, character microstructure deposition layer characterized analyze formation mechanism as-fabricated sample suppression mechanism TiFe IMCs. Moreover, examine distribution state properties, cross-section hardness, compress-shear strength, crack behavior typical position examined verify steady DED-arc fabrication process. Lastly, considering practical application titanium-steel LMC, corrosion behavior cross section titanium deposition surface discussed based corrosion procedure artificial sea water corrosion product broaden application manufacturing industry.2.

Microstructure formation mechanismExisting research suggested difficult eliminate TiFe TiC IMCs using single method. Thus, chemical alloying physical isolation produced DED-arc process. Fig. 16 show schematic image TA2–304SS LMC microstructure formation procedure based microstructure results. relevant microstructure formation mechanism discussed based schematic image follows.(1)When arc melt CuNi10Fe1Mn welding wire deposit 304 SS substrate, liquid metal bottom solidify first due relatively fast heat dissipation rate substrate, high temperature gradient small tendency undercooling lead formation planar grain early stage solidification. deposition proceeds, heat dissipation CuNi10Fe1Mn 304 SS substrate suppressed, arises small heat transfer coefficient stainless steel, temperature gradient declines. small constitutional supercooling zone form front liquid-solid interface, cellular grain protrude liquid metal formation planar grain suppressed. However, convex part dendritic grain cannot stretch fully due complex heat dissipation microdomain; effect exerted surface tension, cellular grain formed, presented layer B Fig. 5(b). increase deposition height, heat dissipation condition tends deteriorate, heat accumulation increase continuously, constitutional supercooling increase solidification front. convex part continues grow subcooled liquid metal, branch side liquid metal, secondary axis cellular grain protrudes dendritic grain forms, presented layer C Fig. 5(b). temperature reach solidification point, constitutional undercooling reach maximum, equiaxial grain without specific growth direction occurs [38], illustrated layer Fig. 5(b). Furthermore, dendritic segregation found among above-mentioned grains. dendritic branch solidify first enriched high-melting-point component Fe, whereas dendrite form later low-rich-melting-point-components Cu [39].(2)When depositing copper‑nickel alloy Interlayer2, energy input adopted melt deposition metal heat treat Interlayer1. one hand, liquid copper‑nickel metal Interlayer1 solidify quickly due good heat dissipation copper layer. Moreover, massive large-size dendritic grain formed. hand, Interlayer1 undergo quick heat treatment, sufficient energy facilitate diffusion elements. Consequently, segregation induced first deposition relieved. Moreover, recovery recrystallization phenomenon occur due high temperature fabricating process. Specifically, dendritic grain sharp corner dissolved due highest surface energy, shape turn increasingly circular. Nevertheless, seldom melt found Interlayer1 since deposition material Interlayer1 Interlayer2 small amount Fe atom involved Interlayer2, verified chemical composition Table 4.(3)When depositing pure titanium, upper Interlayer2 melt due high melting point titanium, Cu Ni atom play certain role TA2 deposition layer Ti-based IMCs form. Moreover, different thermal effect affect microstructure Interlayer2 Interlayer1 thermal cycle suffered Interlayer1 twice Interlayer2. Thus, progress recovery recrystallization different due different heating cooling condition. Consequently, large number equiaxial small grain form dendrite boundary Interlayer1 longer time elemental diffusion. meantime, large size dendritic grain formed Interlayer2 sharp corner due lack diffusion time. Besides, flow melting pool increase approaching TA2 layer. Quick heat dissipation beneficial solidification island-like Ti2Cu + α-Ti eutectic microstructure found region. that, melting pool rich low melting point Cu element begin solidified TiCu matrix forms. Significantly, metal depositing layer layer, heat dissipation direction change verified dendritic grain growing TA2 layer Interlayer2, suggested heat dissipates upwards easily.Download : Download high-res image (589KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 16. schematic image microstructure formation procedure (a) solidification interlayer1, (b) solidification Interlayer2 (c) solidification TA2 deposition layer.Based discussion micorstructure formation procedure, amount IMCs formed XRD analysis result whole sample shown Fig. 17. difference EDS result XRD result attributed different detect capability character. existing γ-Fe, α-Ti due chemical composition substrate welding wire.

Fig. 18 show fractured sample microstructure near crack different positions. Since copper‑nickel alloy interlayer1 deposited directly 304SS substrate, difficult cut interlayer1 apart precisely along substrate surface, thus, residual interlayer1 found Fig. 18(a, d, g) severe deformation found bottom.

Fractured sample microstructure near crack different locations: (a)(b)(c)arc ignition position, (d)(e)(f)middle steady burning position, (g)(h)(i)arc extinguishing position.For crack initiation, due fixed support point, bottom interlayer1 one potential crack initiation position. addition, stress concentration induced highest hardness transition interlayer biggest hardness difference near transition interlayer, transition interlayer another crack initiation position. crack initiates, crack extend along weak bonding position. Although interlayer1 bottom contact area, crack extend along Interlayer2/TA2 interface, attributed two reasons. One formation brittle IMCs interface, easy induce stress concentration. Based fractured sample image Fig. 18(a, d, g), deformation occurs copper‑nickel alloy interlayer due good plasticity. progress compress, deformation position occurred stress concentration Interlayer2/TA2 interface. difference thermophysical property interlayers, thus inducing residual stress contributing crack propagation [29]. Accordingly, crack easy extend along Interlayer2/TA2 interface. Moreover, exception main crack along interface, secondary crack extend along intergranular observed well Fig. 18(c, f, i) shows. reason attributed poor bonding state TiCu IMCs low melting point eutectic microstructure, lead formation secondary crack origin. aggravation deformation compress shear test, secondary crack extend.4.3.

IntroductionAISI 304 austenite stainless steel (SS) widely used extreme working condition various industry including nuclear, petrochemical, marine environments, etc. excellent mechanical property high corrosion resistance [1], [2], [3]. However, high-temperature service condition unproper welding process often lead sensitization deterioration corrosion resistance [4], [5]. acknowledged sensitization cause electrochemical difference matrix Cr-depleted zone induced grain boundary carbides, leading intergranular corrosion (IGC) [1], [6], [7], [8]. Besides, external load, IGC tends stress corrosion cracking (SCC) initiation site cause catastrophic failure [9], [10], [11]. Many study focused IGC behavior mechanism 304 SS, dip SCC behavior mechanism sensitized 304 SS. importantly, 304 SS key components, difficult identify microstructure evaluate SCC risk service. Therefore, necessary develop evaluation model rapidly assessing microstructure evolution SCC susceptibility.However, actual service condition, SCC mechanism controlling factor varying complex, make difficult SCC assessment evaluation. SCC always considered attributed mixture anodic dissolution (AD) hydrogen embrittlement (HE) [12]. Cathodic protection (CP) one common measure inhibiting corrosion usually applied carbon steels. practical engineering applications, SS always coupled carbon steel therefore also CP conditions. However, cases, CP may bring issue increasing SCC susceptibility [13], [14], [15], [16]. Therefore, urgent ass SCC susceptibility 304 SS CP. Many study conducted effect CP SCC behavior mechanism. Liu et al. [17] put quantitative model SCC susceptibility pipeline steel based non-steady electrochemistry, proved effective ass SCC susceptibility CP understand mechanism. et al. [18] adopted model estimate SCC susceptibility marine steel difference slow-scan fast-scan polarization curves, concluded optimum CP potential − 850 mVSCE. Wu et al. [19] used model explain SCC mechanism micro-alloyed steel, revealed intrinsic reason promotion effect micro-alloy SCC resistance. study proved non-steady electrochemical theory effective studying SCC behavior mechanism low-alloy steels. However, electrochemical behavior SS great discrepancy owing passivation, model may applicable. Besides, spite high SCC risk 304 SS, fast assessment method SCC susceptibility mechanism lacking.Therefore, fill research gap, studied SCC behavior mechanism 304 SS polarization potentials. evaluating SCC understanding mechanism, non-steady electrochemical model established, verified SCC susceptibility non-steady electrochemical characteristic 304 SS various microstructures mean electrochemical measurement slow strain rate tensile (SSRT) tests. anticipated provide guidance SCC risk assessment prevention structural component practical engineering application.2.

IntroductionHigh-entropy alloy (HEAs) [1,2] exhibit high strength, excellent high-temperature performance, good wear corrosion resistance, excellent radiation resistance [[3], [4], [5], [6], [7]] owing four core effects: high entropy effect thermodynamics, sluggish diffusion effect dynamics, severe lattice distortion effect structure, cocktail effect performance [[8], [9], [10], [11], [12]]. AlxCoCrFeNi HEAs, one mature common used industrial manufacture, present ultrahigh strength, ductility irradiation resistance [13,14]. considered promising candidate key structural material satisfy critical requirement extreme service conditions, particularly field advanced nuclear energy system aerospace industries. accelerate industrial application HEAs, scholar evaluating performance high-temperature resistance radiation resistance AlxCoCrFeNi HEA component research processing technology resolve challenge associated preparation, processing, characterization HEAs. Among research challenges, important one joining HEAs dissimilar joint HEAs alloy limit industrial application HEAs.In recent years, joining technology HEAs developed significantly, available joining approach mainly include gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), laser beam welding (LBW), diffusion bonding brazing [[15], [16], [17], [18]]. GTAW HEAs, grain coarsening weld element segregation disappearance GTAW weaken joint performance [19,20]. LBW HEAs-related joints, sharp decrease joint strength, element segregation, formation complex phase large thermal cycle occurred [21,22]. brazing HEAs, formation brittle IMCs interface generates joint embrittlement filler penetration-induced stress concentration [[23], [24], [25]]. high melting point sluggish diffusion effect HEAs result higher bonding temperature longer holding time [26,27]. Therefore, bonding temperature effectively reduced formation brittle compound prevented employing appropriate intermediate filler layer [28,29]. However, HEAs used filler metal, owing high mixing entropy generated multi-components, promote formation random solid solution, improve solid solution strengthening ability joint, prevent formation brittle phase, contribute improving joint performance. Zhang et al. [30] brazed ZrB2-SiC-C GH99 superalloys using active composite filler composed equiatomic CrFeCoNiCu HEA pure Ti foil. result revealed higher mixing entropy Ti/CrFeCoNiCu HEA composite filler maintained activity Ti Cr brazing process affected interfacial reaction Ti Cr. joint mainly contained (TiB + Cr-B) solid solution structure, joint higher shear strength. Bridges et al. [31] used Ni-Mn-Fe-Co-Cu HEA filler laser braze Inconel 718 superalloy, maximum shear strength achieved brazed joint 220 MPa brazing temperature 1165 °C. Wang et al. [32,33] developed employed CrFeCoNiCu HEA braze SiC, SiC, ZrB2, respectively. interfacial composition mainly composed high-entropy FCC, Cu (s, s), Si (s, s), Cr23C6 phases. brazed joint mainly solid solution phase higher shear strength. addition, HEAs filler high melting temperature (Tm) make unsuitable brazing HEAs typical high-melting-point alloy systems. Therefore, doping HEAs filler Tm depressant element decrease liquidus temperature inhibits formation ordered intermetallic compounds. Tillman et al. [34] doped equiatomic CrFeCoNiCu HEA Ga study brazing temperature composite HEAs filler. result indicated liquidus temperature filler decreased 1259 °C Ga content reached 16.66 at.%. Hardwick et al. [35] added Ge main melting point depressant form NiCrFeGeB HEA filler, liquidus temperature 1055 °C identified. filler used vacuum braze Inconel 718 superalloy 1100 °C, maximum shear strength achieved 297 MPa 60 min hold time. decrease melting point HEAs fillers, usually necessary add large number melting-point depressants. However, liquidus temperature still much higher Ni-based fillers.Herein, novel brazing route first developed produce HEAs joint lower temperature judiciously stacking three thin foil differ nature functionality, namely highly reaction Ni/Al multilayers nanofoils act fast auxiliary heating source (heating unit), NiCr/FeCo nano-multilayer film (HEAf unit), Al foil (filler unit). brazing process, pressure applied bring functional nanofoils close contact other, composite assembly brazed atmospheric conditions. temperature exceeded thermal explosion temperature Al/Ni reactive multilayer nanofoils, self-propagating reactive (SHS) ignited thermal explosion. ignition, SHS reaction velocity Al/Ni reactive multilayer nanofoils high 5–7.2 m/s, heat released ranged −41 −59 kJ/mol [[36], [37], [38], [39], [40]]. plenty heat release absorbed HEAf unit filler layer melting adjacent low-melting point filler. brazing pressure temperature used combine HEAf unit Ni/Al product two reacted together form HEAs structure via polymorphic transformation, realizes joining base materials. synthesis temperature HEAs significantly reduced introducing HEAf-unit. Wang et al. [41] synthesized CuCrCoFeNiO HEA annealing Cu (11 nm)/CrNiO (16.5 nm)/CoFe (20 nm) nano-multilayered film 600–1000 °C 5 min. Wang et al. [42] rapidly synthesized B2 AlCoCrFeNi HEAf CrNi/Al/CoFe multilayers using Al/Ni nano-reactive film auxiliary heat source. However, Al/Ni nano-reaction film extensively employed dissimilar metal composite material bonding. reason Al/Ni undergoes exothermic reaction local high-temperature source, reduces welding heat input minimizes possible thermal damage base metal [[43], [44], [45], [46], [47]]. Simultaneously, functionally gradient layer synthesized situ joining process alleviate difference material properties.In study, effect welding pressure microstructure shear strength novel brazed joint comprehensively studied. microstructure evolution mechanism strengthening mechanism HEAs brazed joint revealed. reliable joining 304SS Al0.1CoCrFeNi HEA realized using self-propagating brazing nano-multilayer films. brazed joint Al0.1CoCrFeNi HEA 304 stainless steel used manufacturing core structures, pipelines, heat exchangers, key part nuclear reactors. significant practical application value nuclear power plant aviation industry [48,49].2.

[51] showed ΔHmix much greater ΔSmix, driving force ΔGmix phase formation could represented ΔHmix. Therefore, effective concentration proposed calculation effective enthalpy expressed follows:(2)∆H′=ΔH∗effective concentration limiting element/compound concentration limiting elementAccording Fe-Al binary phase diagram, eutectic temperature Fe-Al 660 °C, effective concentration Al Fe eutectic point 99.1% 0.9%, respectively. shown Fig. 7 (d) different Fe-Al phase formation enthalpy follow order ∆H'AlFe3 > ∆H′Al2Fe > ∆H′Al3Fe > ∆H′Al5Fe2. effective formation enthalpy Al5Fe2 lowest, indicates driving force required generate Al5Fe2 phase least. Thus, Al5Fe2 generated preferentially interface, consistent EDS XRD results.In order verify formation possibility dual-phases solid solution joint, according “Hume-Rothery” criterion HEAs system [52], three parameter affect formation HEAs solid solution phase proposed: difference atomic radius (δr), enthalpy mixing (energy atom binding other, ΔHmix) entropy mixing (ΔSmix) combined phase formation criterion HEAs, valence electron concentration (VEC) proposed criterion solid solution formation [53]. calculation method follows:(3)ΔHmix=∑i=1,i≠jn4ΔHijcicj(4)ΔSmix=−R∑i=1ncilnci(5)r−=∑i=1nciri(6)δr=∑i=1nci1−rir−2(7)VEC=∑i=1nciVECiwhere ΔHij interaction parameter i-th element j-th element form order solid solution structure, R gas constant, ri atomic radius i-th element, (VEC)i valence electron concentration i-th element, ci cj atomic percentage i-th j-th element, respectively. According Eq. (1), high mixing entropy effectively diminish formation free energy alloy improve stability. high temperatures, mixing entropy high enough cancel effect mixing enthalpy, resulting formation solid solution phase. forming condition solid solution structure need meet δr < 6.5%；-15 kJ/mol ≤ ΔHmix ≤ 5 kJ/mol；11 J/mol*K ≤ ΔSmix ≤ 17.5 J/mol*K [1,54].

Microstructure evolution modelBased interfacial microstructure analysis, microstructure evolution model typical Al0.1CoCrFeNi/Al-Ni/Al/HEAf-304SS joint divided following four stages, shown Fig. 9. First, surrounding Al filler partially melted temperature exceeded thermal explosion temperature Al/Ni reactive multilayer nanofoils. Then, molten Al filler began rapidly wet spread 304SS-HEAf NiAl IMCs, shown Fig. 9b. interface liquid filler alloy solid substrate beneficial diffusion reaction elements. Al/Ni-reactive multilayer nanofoils released large amount heat, beneficial formation disordered solid solutions.Download : Download high-res image (757KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 9. Microstructural evolution model typical joint: (a) thermal explosion reactive Al/Ni, (b) filler melting, (c) formation Al5Fe2 diffusing substrates, (d) formation FCC + BCC phase brazing process.Second, fluidity liquid Al filler enhanced temperature reached 700 °C, higher solidus temperature Al (660 °C), facilitated dissolution 304SS-HEAf molten filler alloy. concentration gradient filler/substrate interface promoted vigorous reactions. increase number Al atom diffused 304SS-HEAf, composition respective element reached stoichiometry Al5Fe2 IMCs, shown Fig. 9c. lowest effective formation enthalpy favored formation Al5Fe2. Hence, Al5Fe2 first product, preferentially formed interface diffusion zone.Subsequently, brazing joint held 60 min 1050 °C brazing pressure 40 MPa. Interdiffusion respective element activated process. atom highly active state, concentration gradient filler/substrate interface promoted interfacial diffusion atoms, making element distribution diffusion region joint uniform. According microstructural characteristics, AlNi rich BCC phase Co-Cr-Fe rich FCC phase formed diffusion region HEAf/NiAl interface, (as shown Fig. 9d), formation mechanism explained Eqs. (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) mentioned above. According previous studies, formation solid solution phase satisfies following conditions: δr ≤ 6.5%; −15 kJ/mol ≤ ΔHmix ≤ 5 kJ/mol, 11 J/mol*K ≤ ΔSmix ≤ 17.5 J/mol*K. calculation composition diffusion zone Table 3 illustrates ΔНmix, ΔSmix, δr meet rule solid solution formation. Therefore, diffusion zone formed BCC + FCC double solid solution structure.Finally, typical interfacial microstructure joint brazed 1050 °C 60 min 304SS base metal/BCC phase, FCC phase, Al5Fe2 IMCs/Al0.1CoCrFeNi HEA base metal.4.2. Strengthening mechanism fracture modeAs previously described, brazed joint dual-phase solid solution structure exhibited excellent mechanical properties. study, property observed joint brazed 1050 °C 60 min pressure 40 MPa. strengthening mechanism high entropy solution discussed next paper. high entropy solid solution strengthening effect mainly due fact Al, Co, Cr, Fe, Ni considerable solid solubility diffusion zone. solution reaction diffusion region result phase transformation initial FeCo/CrNi high-entropy alloy film, Al filler, Ni/Al reaction multilayer nanofoils, resulting formation core coexistence microstructure FCC BCC phases. FCC + BCC structure simultaneously yield high strength excellent toughness, greatly improves joint performance. However, entire brazing process performed atmospheric environment, formation oxide significantly limit shear strength joint.During shearing process, two different fracture mode observed, shown Fig. 10. first fracture mode, corresponding brazing pressure 20 MPa, fracture mainly occurred base metal diffusion zone, suggesting interface vulnerable part brazed joint (as shown Fig. 10(a)). base metal filler close contact, atomic diffusion fully occur brazing process. time, Al layer oxidized brazing, caused large amount oxide layer joint surface (see zone II Fig. 5). Owing presence interface, large amount oxide remain fracture surface joint 20 MPa. stress concentration periphery oxide large, large amount microcracks appeared. shear force applied, crack initially occurred propagated periphery oxides. shear force persistently increased, crack expanded gradually forward along interface (as shown Fig. 10(a)), width microscopic gap increased continually, joint eventually fractured. Xia et al. [55] observed microcracks initiated propagated behavior Al/steel interface determined interfacial bonding strength situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technology. interface joined 10 μm IMCs, microcracks initiated propagated along IMCs layer steel/Al interface bonding strength joint lower. Therefore, provides evidence joint 20 MPa.Download : Download high-res image (134KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 10. Schematic plot fracture modes: brazed pressure (a) 20 MPa, (b) 40 MPa.The second fracture mode corresponds joint brazed pressure 40 MPa (as shown Fig. 10(b)). joint, fracture occurred diffusion area interior NiAl IMCs, first crack occurring NiAl IMCs extending interface propagating side solid solution area. Owing presence FeAl IMCs oxide inclusion solid solution area, strength joint weakened. However, oxide accumulated inside dimple welding pressure 40 MPa(see zone III Fig. 5(f)). shear force applied, crack initially occurred propagated periphery oxides, deflected interface solid solution zone (as shown Fig. 10(b)). microcracks generated along grain boundary, phase boundary, oxide phase, IMCs, extend direction base metal, causing brazed joint interface diffusion area 304SS/NiAl IMCs gradually separate, ultimately forming microscopic gaps. shear force persistently increased, crack expanded gradually forward solid solution zone, width microscopic gap increased continually, joint eventually fractured. According study Xia et al. [55], intermetallic layer thinner, microcracks first start root IMCs layer propagated interior layer, bonding strength joint higher. Therefore, fracture mode joint 40 MPa verified.5.

Supplementary data Supplemental Material README Corrosion generally regarded electrochemical process occurs interface metal contacting aqueous environment. Therefore, surface condition vital importance corrosion performance metallic material. generally believed nanocrystalline metallic surface different corrosion performance bulk material micron-sized grains, despite absence unified theory.1 Nanocrystalline surface achieved using number processing route rolling, working, extrusion, electrodeposition, sputtering, various milling methods, might different corrosion performance. example, study showed magnetron sputtered nanocrystalline 304 SS exhibited greatly enhanced corrosion resistence,2 mechanically-processed nanocrystalline 304 SS inconsistent corrosion performance.1 term mechanism, study claiming nanocrystalline metal improved corrosion resistance attributed improved passive films. nanocrystalline material drastically increased volume fraction grain boundaries, higher energy (i.e. active) bulk material, nanocrystalline surface higher reactivity, facilitates formation protective oxide layer.1 mechanical technique obtaining nanocrystalline surface include hydrostatic extrusion (HE),3 laser shock peening (LSP),4,5 surface mechanical attrition treatment (SMAT)6–8 ultrasonic nanocrystal surface modification (UNSM).9,10 SMAT technique involves mechanically inducing surface modification severe plastic deformation (SPD) using high-velocity (1–20 m/s) steel balls.11 ball accelerated collision ball vibrating chamber. vibrating chamber driven either electric motor (Type SMAT) ultrasonic generator (Type II SMAT). SMAT process achieved ultrasonic generator named ultrasonic shot peening (USP USSP).11 USP, high intense ultrasonic vibration usually larger 20 kHz. SMAT processing (including USP) successfully applied fabricate nanocrystalline surface carbon steel stainless steels,12–14 titanium,15 aluminum alloys,16,17 magnesium alloys.18,19 grain refinement mechanism include deformation via dislocation slip mechanical twinning.11 combination surface nanostructure residual compressive stress result increased surface hardness, tensile strength, fatigue resistance, wear resistance, friction properties.11 Besides mechanical property SMAT-treated metallic materials, corrosion behavior also investigated.15,20–27 However, still controversial whether SMAT treatment enhances diminishes corrosion performance treated materials. Hao et al.23 discovered SMAT induced large number crack 316 SS surface therefore reduced corrosion resistance 0.1 NaCl. Furthermore, found annealing SMAT-treated 316 SS could greatly improve corrosion resistance material. Balusamy et al.22,24,25 found SMAT different effect corrosion resistance 304 SS 409 SS 0.6 NaCl and/or Ringer's solution depending size steel ball (D = 2, 5, 8 mm). general, smaller ball (D = 2 mm) resulted enhanced corrosion resistance. attributed deterioration corrosion performance larger ball increase roughness, martensite content dislocation density via SMAT treatment. Gatey et al.26 found appropriate extent SMAT processing improved corrosion resistance 304L SS 3.5 wt% NaCl increase peening intensity adversely affected corrosion resistance SMAT-treated 304L SS. Li et al.27 also proved increment SMAT duration increased active dissolution rate 316L SS room temperature. However, SMAT-treated material better corrosion performance 300°C (steam generator environment) due formation dense protective oxide layer nanocrystalline surface.27 addition defect crack caused SMAT processing, contamination steel ball also found affect corrosion performance SMAT-treated materials, especially aluminum magnesium alloys.28,29 UNSM relatively new technique involves mechanically striking material surface using stylus tungsten carbide (WC) ball, higher hardness better wear resistance steel ball used SMAT. technique, static load applied stylus superimposed cyclic low amplitude, high frequency (10–30 kHz) ultrasonic striking (dynamic load).30,31 interaction static dynamic load material surface UNSM processing major advantage SPD technologies. Similar SMAT treatment, UNSM process induces high-intensity SPD lead nanocrystallization sample surface.9 Moreover, UNSM better-controlled process compared SMAT, term intensity density strike therefore result homogeneously-modified surface layers. well-controlled feature also render UNSM processing highly repeatable thus reliable industrial applications. addition, use single WC ball induces less/no contamination treated surfaces, compared caused large amount steel ball used SMAT. Despite increasing effort surface nanocrystallization metallic material using UNSM, research activity mainly focused mechanical property treated materials. Limited research performed investigate effect UNSM-induced surface nanocrystallization corrosion performance treated materials. hypothesized well-controlled UNSM processing able produce uniformly-modified surface many fewer crack better corrosion performance SMAT. present work, corrosion performance UNSM-treated 304 SS sample compared untreated (control) sample analysis metastable pitting events, early stage pitting process.32–35 Enhanced pitting resistance observed UNSM-treated 304 SS correlated microstructural change induced UNSM.

First, believed nanocrystalline surface favor formation stable compact passive film low defect density.1 previously published research,36 higher density grain boundary larger fraction surface area fine-grained stainless steel facilitate Cr diffusion passive film therefore result greater Cr enrichment passive film.2,55 greater Cr enrichment passive film nanocrystalline stainless steel also proved present work (Figures 7b–7d). also suggested nanocrystalline structure could inhibit incorporation chloride anion passive films.2 Similarly, XPS result present work showed passive film UNSM-treated 304 SS le Cl control sample (Figures 7e 7f). Second, inclusion particle analysis showed mechanical strike UNSM treatment result cleaner surface removing half inclusion particle (area fraction) 304 SS surface (Figure 2). commonly accepted pitting corrosion stainless steel usually initiate non-metallic inclusions.53,54,56–60 Although different mechanism proposed pit initiation MnS inclusions, certain sulfur play important role pit initiation. comparison two different 304 SS material (sheet vs. rod) suggests UNSM process remove MnS inclusion completely. removal MnS inclusion particle 304 SS UNSM treatment diminished pitting susceptible site therefore enhanced pitting resistance 304 SS.54 UNSM treatment might also decreased inclusion/matrix interfacial micro-cracks61 (if any) thus reduces occurrence pitting. Third, found UNSM processing generates compressive residual stress 304 SS.9 presence compressive residual stress surface UNSM-treated 304 SS may also increase pitting corrosion resistance material, similar previously reported.62,63 Lastly, worthwhile mentioning UNSM-induced transformation austenite martensite likely contribute corrosion performance enhancement 304 SS, according previous studies.64,65 ConclusionsSurface nanocrystallization 304 SS achieved using novel method called ultrasonic nanocrystal surface modification (UNSM). found UNSM-induced mechanical striking resulted nanocrystalline surface 304 SS surface also cleaner surface (i.e., le area fraction inclusion particles) compared control sample. nanoscale grain refinement led greater Cr enrichment surface passive film 304 SS, breakdown removal inclusion particles, especially MnS 304 SS surface rendered le susceptible site pitting corrosion. factor contributed greatly improved pitting corrosion resistance 304 SS 3.5 wt% NaCl.

Nevertheless, environmental concern ineffective quality monitoring limited development automated laser welding industrial usage. One important dilemma laser welding technology setting parameter pulse duration, focus point, used power rate [9]. Weld pool geometry also considerable effect welding quality [[10], [11], [12], [13]]; therefore, investigating connection mentioned parameter weld pool geometry helpful recognize welding process aspect find suitable model control parameter. Numerous research conducted monitor weld pool condition. focused heat distribution [14,15], concentrated emission signal [7,16,17], others targeted weld pool image attained charge-coupled device camera [12,18]. stated laser welding complicated physicochemical thermodynamic process, including evaporating, plasma, material melting, heat affected zone keyhole occurrence, forming forth. Usually, linear nonlinear analytical numerical method used simulate actual industrial application [[19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24]]. Additionally, model introduced laser welding process linear models; however, parameter nonlinear effect welding process influence system performance [25]. Thus, achieve better result better laser welding dealt nonlinear process. common practice use linear model estimate nonlinear system; however, operation region control system designed linear model limited range. Accordingly, nonlinear model based input-output data preferred comprehend global behaviour laser welding process consequently obtain higher operation region system. Block-oriented system widely used system modelling engineering practice [[26], [27], [28], [29]]. Wiener Hammerstein structure one representative class objects, may combination linear dynamic nonlinear static blocks. linear non-linear model posse decent approximation property considerably discussed literature [[30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35]]. study, focus Wiener–Hammerstein (LNL) system inherits property structures. Wiener–Hammerstein model separate linear nonlinear part system. model, input output nonlinear part static, middle linear part dynamic. Therefore, Wiener–Hammerstein model flexible enough capture complicated nonlinear dynamic phenomenon real processes. Furthermore, due block representation, straightforward implement method various problems. Owing advantages, Wiener–Hammerstein method widely used black-box grey-box system identification problem [[36], [37], [38]].Fig. 1 show set two linear dynamic block internal static nonlinear block connections. LNL system demanding identification stage, usually due correlation nonlinearity input caused first dynamic subsystem. Therefore, LNL system, limited identification algorithm analysed proposed [39]. approach proposed mentioned work employ different specific approach aggregative modelling approach [17], Gaussian input (BLA) [35,40], Volterra Wiener series expansion [25,41], gradient method [42] maximum-likelihood based method [43]. Numerous study Wiener–Hammerstein model conducted reduce prior restriction imposed system characteristic input excitation [36,[44], [45], [46], [47], [48]]. nonlinear method literature based discrete models; however, advanced analysis, nonlinear system required. Hence first time, Hammerstein-Wiener method utilized discrete proper model dissimilar laser joining S.S 304 ABS.

Numerical methodNormally, nonlinear system identification method fall two groups, namely parametric non-parametric methods. questioned system’s structure available previous assumption, identification problem may reduced parameter approximation problem, basically optimization problem. Thus, approach black, grey white box tactic employed depending whether model description general ready-made tailor-made model set incorporating priori structural info employed. Alternatively, limited priori information available structure system, identification method non-parametric. non-parametric approach usually need sophisticated optimization technique parametric one demand. method non-parametric system identification referred technique aiming predicting complex behaviour system without selecting confined set possible regressors. Therefore, use explicitly finite-dimensional parameter vector.The dissimilar laser welding process complex phenomenon due following reasons:•It inherently nonlinear system connection amongst input output system highly nonlinear.•It dynamic system, namely system whose output function time.•The system memory; words, system output function previous value system input outputs.•It multi-input system; words, several parameter affect outputs. difficult separate effect individual input system output.•The system behaviour investigated various range input parameter values. Thus, impossible find operating point linearize model around them.Hence, nonlinear model identification required determine connection input output system predict system behaviour unknown inputs. several nonlinear identification methods. paper, Hammerstein-Wiener method examined identify dissimilar laser joining S.S 304 ABS. Hammerstein-Wiener mathematical model identify nonlinear dynamic phenomena. Hammerstein-Wiener aim interpret system parallel linear nonlinear part time-variant phenomenon captured linear part nonlinearities captured nonlinear parts. several nonlinearity estimator Hammerstein-Wiener method, piecewise linear function, wavelet network, one-layer sigmoid network, dead zone, saturation one-dimensional polynomial. Furthermore, transfer function linear part numerator denominator dissimilar orders. Therefore, Hammerstein-Wiener method potential implemented identify various nonlinear dynamic systems. Hammerstein-Wiener method usually employed black-box identification method. However, may used grey-box identification method insight physical phenomenon governing system. model Hammerstein-Wiener model comprises two input output static nonlinear block side dynamic linear block.
