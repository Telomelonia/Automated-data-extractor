SS-316L exhibit excellent corrosion resistance improved mechanical property SS-304 [2]. However, element (Ni) added considerable amount SS-316L. price Ni drastically shooting towards higher side day day resulted increased cost SS-316L [3, 4]. Therefore, excessive utilization SS-316L industry viable economic point view. ferritic stainless steel (FSS) also widely utilized industry due higher resistance chloride stress corrosion cracking. Further, FSS lower thermal expansion coefficient high thermal conductivity compared austenitic SS-316L. Therefore, FSS show economic alternative SS-316L utilized industries. many application require welding FSS austenitic SS petrochemical, gas oil industry component like evaporators heat exchangers. dissimilar joining FSS austenitic SS critical due hot corrosion cracking austenitic SS low weldability FSS. Further, grain growth observed heat-affected zone (HAZ) fusion zone (FZ) FSS due absence phase transformations, resulted low ductility toughness fabricated weldment [5]. Therefore, careful selection process filler material play important role fabrication sound dissimilar weldment. literature, found dissimilar SS-316L SS-430 metal welded using various fusion welding process like gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), metal inert gas (MIG) welding shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) etc. However, property (Mechanical metallurgical) fabricated weldment depend strongly upon process parameter filler material utilized process [6,7,8]. work carried welding SS-316L SS-430 various fusion welding process briefly reviewed following sections.

Aguilar et al. [8] reported dissimilar SS-316L FSS-430 joint utilizing two electrodes: E309L austenitic E 2209-16 duplex stainless steel 3.2 mm diameter. Grain coarsening HAZ ferritic side whereas grain coarsening HAZ SS-316L side le filler conditions; caused due high heat input significant variation thermal conductivity parent metal (SS-430 SS-316L) joined. Further, author reported excellent metallurgical bonding almost similar tensile strength weldments. tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding SS-430 SS-316L utilizing two welding consumables (ER 310 ER 2594) carried Jeraldnavinnsavio et al.

Kumar et al. [11] reported dissimilar welding SS-316 SS-430 using ER 304L filler material MIG welding process. author investigated effect heat input metal deposition rate, tensile strength weld bead varying current 60, 80, 90, 100 A. author reported current increased, metal deposition rate, tensile strength weld bead increased too. But, decrease tensile strength observed 100 A, due formation columnar coarser grain HAZ FZ, led increase brittleness consequently substantial decrease tensile strength high current observed. discussion, found massive demand joining dissimilar material various engineering applications. dissimilar joint fabricated via conventional joining technique (as discussed above) performs satisfactory service life. However, researcher looking forward join SS-316L SS-430 utilizing novel, energy well time efficient, cost-effective, environment-friendly easily available welding approach meet global industrial requirements.

Therefore, notable research result published processing material efficient effective way using microwave energy [13]. However, bulk metallic material offered greater level difficulty processing directly microwave room temperature due considerably low skin bulk metallic material room temperature. Due low skin depth, reflect microwave produce spark exposed directly microwave room temperature [12, 13]. However, metallic material treated powder form utilizing microwave energy metallic powder particle size equivalent microwave's skin depth [14].

Further, SS-316L lower thermal conductivity (8.54 w/m*k) resulted lower thermal diffusion higher volumetric heat capacity (3966 cm−3 K−1) [21, 22]. hand, significant grain growth (about 200–250 µm) coarse ferritic along martensite phase preferably grain boundary (GB’s) HAZ SS-430 BMs along join interface SS-430 observed. formation coarse grain HAZ due single phase BCC structure related SS-430 along high thermal conductivity (15.76 w/m*k) lower volumetric heat capacity (3542 cm−3 K−1) [22, 23]. reason grain coarsening grain growth phenomenon mainly controlled diffusion process, driven surface energy requires nucleation. present research work, energy mainly provided molten joint zone region. Therefore, heat move quickly molten filler powder particle towards HAZ area SS-430 conduction process hybrid MH process consequently cause coarsening grain HAZ SS-430. Further, formation martensite also seen ferritic GB’s HAZ along joint interface. microwave joining process, HAZ experienced high temperature resulted formation austenite ferritic GB’s austenite converted martensite due high cooling rate. martensite transformation mainly occurs GB’s high energy available locations. formation martensite consumes C formation carbides.

IntroductionFerritic stainless steel (SS)-430 Fe-Cr based alloy body centred cubic crystal structure. element chromium (Cr) alloy added range 11–30%. alloy exhibit good formability ductility, however, exhibit relatively poor mechanical property high temperature compared austenite grade stainless steel. high heat conduction, low thermal expansion, good resistance stress corrosion important characteristic related ferritic stainless steel [Citation1]. extensively utilized manufacturing furnace parts, heat exchangers, protection tubes, electrical appliances, storage vessels, oil burner parts, petrochemical refining equipment, household appliances, solar water heater [Citation2,Citation3]. joining steel main requirement assemble complex configuration well many structural applications. Fusion-based joining process [gas metal arc welding (GMAW), tungsten inert welding (TIG), shielded metal arc welding (SMAW)] friction welding mostly used fabrication SS-430 SS-430 weldment. process exhibit certain kind advantage limitation respect particular application. fusion welding process cause coarsening grain heat-affected zone (HAZ) detrimental toughness fabricated weldment. issue related fusion-based joining process grain boundary carbide formation sigma phase fusion zone (FZ) HAZ fabricated weldment. issue significant negative impact mechanical characteristic (toughness, ductility, elevated temperature strength) corrosion resistance fabricated weldment. problem grain coarsening effect overcome using various method like low heat input process friction welding [Citation4,Citation5], usage pulsed power TIG welding [Citation6], addition interstitial element improve grain size precipitates, etc. [Citation6]. Sathiya et al. [Citation4] reported friction welding SS-430 weldment. author reported fabricated weldment exhibit 95% property base metal (BM). However, unsymmetrical configuration material cannot joined using friction welding process. Mohandas Reddy [Citation6] reported effect SMAW TIG fabrication SS-430 weldment using stabilizing element like copper (Cu) titanium (Ti). author reported TIG welding lead superior mechanical property compared SMAW due low heat input associated TIG welding process. literature, found limited work reported fusion joining SS-430 weldment. Further, always need join material novel technique le costly eco-friendly. Recently, lot work reported process material using novel microwave technique. Microwave heating applied directly process material good absorber microwave room temperature like polymers, ceramics, composite [Citation7]. processing metal-based material room temperature using microwave challenging task metal conductor reflect microwave room temperature due presence electron cloud [Citation7]. Therefore, bulk metal treated using hybrid microwave heating (MH) approach suitable susceptor utilized joining bulk metallic materials. susceptor material (SiC charcoal) quickly absorbs microwave room temperature heated high temperatures.

IntroductionActive brazing alloy (ABA) widely used brazing metal/ceramic ceramic/ceramic couple various industrial applications. Brazed joint alloy utilize simple process exhibit high bonding strength (49–325 MPa) good oxidation resistance (10−10–10−12 g2 cm−4 s−1 400–600 °C) high temperature 500 °C [1,2,3,4], thus reasonable consider ABA sealing material heterogeneous joint sodium beta-alumina battery (NBBs) operate temperature range 280–350 °C exposed liquid sodium (Na) [5,6,7,8,9,10]. requirement use active brazing alloy Na battery includes high-temperature stability, sufficient bonding strength Al2O3, good corrosion resistance liquid Na. Typical active brazing alloys, Ag-Cu-Ti Cu-Al-Si-Ti, exhibit high-melting temperature 780–910 °C 1001–1024 °C, respectively, provide good bonding strength [2,11]. However, two alloy containing Ag Si soluble liquid Na 350 °C guarantee reliability Na battery [6,7]. order develop advanced high-temperature ABAs, previous study introduced Cu-based brazing alloys, namely Cu-7Al-xTi Cu-7Al-xZr (x = 2.5, 3.5, 4.5) [12]. alloys, Cu parent constituent element determines baseline brazing temperature, Al added adjust (typically lower) liquidus temperature alloys, Ti Zr aid highly chemical reaction forming reaction product Ti-O Zr-O oxide [3,13,14,15]. alloy composed non-reactive element liquid Na 350 °C 500 °C determined inspection Cu-Na [16], Al-Na [17], Ti-Na [18], Zr-Na [19]. solidus point six alloy correspond 965, 965, 965, 945, 945, 933 °C, respectively, liquidus point 1033, 1026, 1013, 1051, 1045, 1025 °C, respectively. Although alloy exhibit good stability high temperature resistance Na corrosion, consecutive study conducted.In considering application new ABAs ceramic–metal joints, preventing crack occurrence caused residual stress, due mismatch coefficient thermal expansion (CTE), important obtain high bonding strength [20,21,22,23,24,25]. order relieve residual stress joint, layer low yield strength high plastic deformation ability previously reported, ceramic particle tungsten carbide (WC) added brazing alloy reduce CTE difference ceramic [25,26,27]. However, previous study considered Si3N4 ceramic examine liquid Na corrosion resistance. Hence, insufficient application ceramic–metal joint NaS cells.In study, considered using lower bonding temperature liquidus solidus temperature brazing alloy, solid–liquid-state bonding, prevent crack occurrence α-Al2O3/SS 430 joint. Commercial brazing process conducted aforementioned melting temperature brazing alloy since liquid-state bonding high temperature process accelerates growth reaction layer interface formation brittle intermetallic compounds, formed dissolution base metal substrate brazing alloy [28,29]. However, solid–liquid state bonding expected prevent dissolution base metal since solubility Fe steel braze decrease lower temperature. Additionally, respect decreased intermetallic compounds, helpful decrease hardness brittleness brazed seam preventing cracking joint [27]. addition, considered solid–liquid state bonding reduces shrinkage stress brazing alloy partial liquid cooling [30].
