TIG welding process electric arc generated non-consumable tungsten electrode plate joined. Dissimilar metal welding (DMW) captivating technique involving joining two metal alloy may vary composition, melting point coefficient thermal expansion [1]. Stainless steel 300 series among material extensively used different infrastructure due excellent mechanical property high resistance corrosion, relatively ease machining welding. Hence, number setback likely come term mechanical metallurgical properties. Selection welding current, diameter filler rod gas flow rate among major challenge joining dissimilar metal alloys. Inappropriate selection parameter may lead metallurgical problem associated formation unwanted secondary phase cracking HAZ [2].Various factor considered prior selecting welding parameter TIG welding may include base metal, surface finish, resistance corrosion etc. advanced application petrochemical, marine, aerospace nuclear installation focus aspect higher resistance corrosion, heat different environment [3] met joining dissimilar metal get robust joint meeting desired characteristics. superior efficiency joint, simplified process, reliability lower fabrication cost necessary manufacturing various engineering component [4]. micro-segregation, solidification cracking material loss vaporization vital problem induce poor property stainless steel weld [5], [6], structural application utilized efficiently welding mild steel economical effective utilization desired property [7].The joining SS mild steel common application automotive, aerospace thermal application often exposed high temperature pressure perform satisfactorily make overall economical. Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) welding, Shielded metal arc welding (SMAW), Metal Inert Gas (MIG) welding exhibited superior mechanical property joint obtained stainless steel low carbon steel [8]. TIG welding provides substantial control SMAW MIG welding processes, provides advanced quality weld wide variety metal alloys. Therefore, commonly used joining stainless steel metal [9], [10].Many researcher conducted study analysed influence various welding aspect mechanical behaviour welded joint reached general conclusion welding current, filler rod diameter, gas flow rate also enhance mechanical property welds.

ConclusionsThe present experiment used fabricate high-performance high-quality weld nugget Ti6321 SS 310 metals. welding done appropriate process condition high-precision vertical machining center. finding investigation presented below.•Friction stir welding successfully used butt weld similar dissimilar joint Ti6321 SS 310 plate varying different parameter transverse tool speed, rotational tool speed, axial force.•Compared joints, microhardness measurement across similar Ti-Ti6321 joint exhibited maximum hardness 374 HV. Joint 4′s hardness increased due uniform weld thick IMC layer, produced 60 mm/min transverse speed 900 mm/min rotational speed.•Joint 4′s maximum tensile strength 927 MPa, joint efficiency 21.3 %. joint's ductility improved even distribution strengthening precipitate Ti throughout WZ consistent flow materials.•The impact strength base material Ti6321 SS 310 48 J 23 J, respectively, lower welded joints. high impact toughness achieved Ti-Ti6321 weld joint 61 J.•Poor bead surface quality traced back microstructure base materials. sample found many pore microscopic cracks. reduced FSW due joining butt joint welded samples. FESEM image clearly showed sample S4 (Ti-Ti joint) smooth surface, crack disappeared. Hence, similar Ti joint high microhardness value, High ultimate strength, Low thermal diffusivity, high toughness compared samples. appearance tiny dimple along tension-fractured surface sample 4 shown ductile mode.•In addition, EDAX analysis tensile sample showed existence strengthening precipitate (Ti) WZ maximize mechanical behaviour similar joint. Ceramic particle (Ti, Si, Mo) accountable effect.•Finally, concludes mechanical characteristic improved using FSW technique Ti-Ti6321similar joint weld region, favorable orthopedic industrial sectors.CRediT authorship contribution statementK.
