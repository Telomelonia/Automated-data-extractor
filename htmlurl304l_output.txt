Comparison highest formable FLCs.Based result mentioned concluded formability sheet rise drop hvs hike spindle speed. reduction hvs decrease gravity forming effect strain hardening. sheet may formed properly, forming equipment may damaged vertical step height large. Hence reducing hvs effective way increase formability sheet.Furthermore, spindle rotates swiveling action created make sheet easier form. Therefore, forming swiveling action result better formability compared forming without spindle rotation low rotation speeds.The friction tool sheet interface play important role sheet metal forming processes. Adequate friction help distribute deformation evenly across sheet, lowering state stress delaying onset crack formation. lead improved formability quality final product. However, friction interface becomes high, sheet may experience excessive strain, cause localized thinning eventual cracking. Therefore, important control friction tool sheet interface optimize forming process prevent defects. liquid lubricant cannot sustained sheet forming perforation it. Hence, semisolid solid lubricant used forming perforated sheets.The relationship formability tool diameter nonconclusive since highest formability achieved medium size tool, i.e., 10 mm ϕ tool. finding better agreement finding Kim et al.

Numerous effort made enhance property 304-grade steel without compromising properties, like corrosion resistance performance high-temperature conditions. gained significant position fabricating structural component like nuclear power equipment [3], [4].With emergence new-generation manufacturing technologies, production metallic structural component also gained faster pace. Additive manufacturing new way creating material products. Since additive manufacturing (AM) rapid prototyping technique, part created depositing material layer create product based CAD model [5]. main advantage additive manufacturing process save significant time production wastage material compared conventional manufacturing process [6]. process also reduce need post-processing producing near-net shaped components.Direct Energy Deposition (DED), one many techniques, important new technology creating metallic component use variety heat sources, including laser electric arc. Depending heat sources, process includes method like laser additive manufacturing, electron beam additive manufacturing, wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM). size restriction constructing part one primary drawback additive manufacturing technologies. Laghi et al. [7]. suggest higher printing speed needed produce part large size, result geometrical flaw compared digital model. However, wire arc additive manufacturing assumed appropriate one producing component greater size without compromising mechanical property [8]. Various welding method like gas tungsten arc welding, gas metal arc welding, plasma arc welding may adopt WAAM technology [9]. wire used input material, heated electric arc start melting robotically controlled place material layers. capacity produce complex component high deposition rate increase acceptance additive manufacturing sector [10]. maintain high deposition rate, sufficient amount heat supplied. repetitive heating made arc input cause heat accumulation lead slow cooling rate building layer reported Xiong et al.

Cooling rate one influential parameter wire arc additive manufacturing considerably impact quality fabricated part especially microstructure mechanical properties. also result problem like product surface texture, poor dimensional precision, inapt formation. reportedly numerous effort manage temperature reduce associated problem [12], [13], [14], [15].Understanding mechanism solidification 304L steel involves microstructural study cast metal determining relationship properties. Based different solidification conditions, microstructure evolution austenitic steel changes. Also, various morphology ferrite may produced due variation cooling rate constituent elements.

Direct evidence offered show obvious progressive work hardening strain rate hardening caused heterogeneous microstructure cyclic deformation, thus enhancing fatigue crack initiation resistance. microstructural result reveal cellular substructure play decisive role regulating dislocation motion cyclic deformation, resulting intergranular fatigue cracking along HAGBs rather twin boundaries.GRAPHICAL ABSTRACTKEYWORDS: Additive manufacturingfatigue resistancemicrostructureworking hardening mechanism 1. IntroductionAustenitic stainless steel (SS), 316L 304L, widely applied kitchen tools, medical implants, oil drilling rigs, nuclear power plants, field due excellent corrosion resistance (Shen et al. Citation2015; Koyama et al. Citation2017; Ferreri et al. Citation2020). Additive manufacturing (AM), disruptive technology modern industries, produce metal part customised geometry constrained design traditional processes, thereby attracting extensive attention research (MacDonald Wicker Citation2016; Martin et al. Citation2017; Khairallah et al. Citation2020). recent studies, austenitic stainless steel via laser powder-bed-fusion (PBF) technique shown excellent ductility tensile strength, overcame strength-ductility trade-off commonly existed pure metal alloy (Liu et al. Citation2018; Wang et al. Citation2018). However, due existence intrinsic defects, fatigue property additively manufactured austenitic steel seriously affected need deeply understood (Sanaei Fatemi Citation2020).Preventing dislocation motion adjusting microstructures widely applied traditional material improve strength metal, sacrifice useful ductility, called strength–ductility trade-off (Kumar, Van Swygenhoven, Suresh Citation2003; Wei et al. Citation2014; Li et al. Citation2016; Liu et al. Citation2018). Surprisingly, process selective laser melting (SLM) PBF technique produce special microstructure due local rapid cooling rate repeated thermal cycle (Liu et al. Citation2018), make SLMed part extremely superior static tensile property far exceeding traditional metallurgical processing (Herzog et al. Citation2016). However, surface roughness (Maleki et al. Citation2020), gas porosity (Svensson, Ackelid, Ab Citation2010), keyhole porosity (Cunningham et al. Citation2019), lack-of-fusion (LoF) defect (Darvish, Chen, Pasang Citation2016), residual stress (Bartlett Li Citation2019) induced process significantly reduce fatigue performance additively manufactured parts. According (Zhang et al. Citation2020a), internal defect surface defect proved critical impact fatigue life additively manufactured 304L SS residual stress. irregular LoF pore induced un-optimised process parameter significantly facilitate fatigue crack initiation lesser extent fatigue crack propagation (Smith et al. Citation2019), small spherical defect (<100 μm diameter) le effect fatigue property LoF defects. Therefore, occurrence LoF pore minimised optimisation process parameter reduce overall porosity, thus enhancing fatigue strength additively manufactured stainless steel (Kumar et al. Citation2020). Furthermore, position size internal pore also affect high cycle fatigue resistance additively manufactured 316L SS (Andreau et al. Citation2021). Surface pore far deleterious internal pore fatigue crack usually originate surface. Therefore, abundant surface treatment method applied eliminate/minimize surface defects, thereby improving fatigue performance additively manufactured austenitic stainless steel (Maleki et al. Citation2020). addition, study adopted post-heat treatment adjust microstructure attempt improve fatigue properties. as-built stress-relieved annealed SLMed 316L SS sample exhibit better fatigue performance traditionally manufactured counterparts, presumed caused strong resistance cellular substructure dislocation flow crack initiation (Elangeswaran et al. Citation2020). solute annealing hot isostatic pressed (HIP) enhance ductility high cycle fatigue performance due coarse-grained microstructures residual stress relaxation (Leuders et al. Citation2013). According research (Cao et al. Citation2020; Elangeswaran et al. Citation2020; Kumar et al. Citation2020; Pegues, Roach, Shamsaei Citation2020), found as-built AMed austenitic stainless steel show superior fatigue performance solute annealing sample traditionally fabricated counterpart despite containing relatively high porosity. superior fatigue property may related unique microstructure caused special manufacturing process PBF technique. However, mechanism unique microstructure fatigue resistance additively manufactured austenitic stainless steel remains elusive.In last five years, many researcher committed obtaining comprehensive understanding microstructure-property relationship additively manufactured austenitic stainless steel (Liu et al. Citation2018; Wang et al. Citation2018; Zhao et al. Citation2020; Zhu et al. Citation2020). twining-induced plasticity (TWIP) behaviour key factor excellent ductility additively manufactured austenitic stainless steel (Pham, Dovgyy, Hooper Citation2017a; Zhu et al. Citation2020). transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) effect austenitic stainless steel low stacking fault energy (SFE) (calculated Eq. (1)) lead secondary work hardening maintains plastic deformation stability (Shen et al. Citation2015; Polatidis et al. Citation2018; Li et al. Citation2019b; Polatidis et al. Citation2020; Zhu et al. Citation2020). (1) SFE=−53+6.2Ni+0.7Cr+3.2Mn+9.3Mo(1) element weight percentage (wt.%). addition, solidification-enabled cellular structures, low-angle grain boundary (LAGBs) pre-existing dislocation network enhance strength, hierarchically heterogeneous microstructure ensures high uniform elongation (Wang et al. Citation2018). pre-existing dislocation network slow entirely block dislocation motion, also promote formation high density nano-twins plastic deformation (Liu et al. Citation2018). mechanism contribute combination high strength high ductility additively manufactured austenitic stainless steels. However, present, almost research focus microstructure-property relationship static strength ductility, little microstructure-property fatigue strength, critical application reliability development technique. mechanism dislocation flow crack formation fatigue process especially different static tensile process due cyclic deformation, high strain rate, long period. Although intrinsic defect part play important role reducing fatigue property (Sanaei Fatemi Citation2020), fatigue property exceeding wrought counterpart (Kumar et al. Citation2020; Pegues, Roach, Shamsaei Citation2020) may potentially related unique heterogeneous microstructure effect, still lacking effective researches.Therefore, article systematically investigates original heterogeneous microstructure 304L austenitic stainless steel selective laser melting (SLM) microstructural evolution fatigue loading numerous electron microscopy characterisations. strengthening mechanism unique heterogeneous microstructure fatigue resistance additively manufactured 304L SS fully discussed base obtained microstructural results. research aim fully understand effect microstructure additively manufactured part fatigue strength provide new data support valuable suggestion reliability improvement metal additive manufacturing techniques.2.

Md30 temperature (∼25.40°C) room temperature led absence martensitic transformation study. addition, temperature part increase cyclic loading (Figure 8(i)), resulting temperature much higher Md30, thus inhibiting TRIP effect. Creq/Nieq used infer solidification process according (Ghayoor et al.

Mechanical testing3.2.1. Tensile testingThe 304L SS produced SLM process parameter used study show excellent strength (∼692 MPa) ductility (∼ 70%) (Figure 4(a)). Interestingly, strength study higher similar study SLMed 304L SS (Ghayoor et al. Citation2020; Hou et al. Citation2020; Zhao et al. Citation2020), close strength SLMed 304L SS (Zhu et al. Citation2020) strength SLMed 316L SS (Liu et al. Citation2018). superior tensile property shown study may caused unique scanning strategy, including island scanning strategy, interlayer rotation 67°, inter-island rotation 90°, enhance homogeneity microstructure part (Figure 1(a f)). island scanning strategy also reduce vector length, resulting significant reduction residual stress, thus minimising adverse effect residual stress (Bartlett Li Citation2019). addition, optimised process parameter make densification part reach 99.8% obtain cellular substructure small size (∼0.886 μm), significantly contribute superior tensile properties. According existing literature (Liu et al. Citation2018; Wang et al. Citation2018), additively manufactured austenitic stainless steel break strength-ductility trade-off, exhibit combination high strength high ductility compared conventional austenitic steels. important reason mechanical property improved collective effect hierarchically heterogeneous microstructures, including solidification cellular structure, LAGBs, dislocation (Wang et al. Citation2018). addition, unique cellular structure decorated high-density pre-existing dislocation network adjust stabilise dislocation flow (Figure 2), promoting working hardening tensile testing (Liu et al. Citation2018). elastic deformation (low strain) stage, pre-existing dislocation network structure around cell wall prevent dislocation motion (Liu et al. Citation2018), thus increasing dislocation storage ability, resulting high yield strength. strain hardening rate decrease rapidly stage elastic deformation decrease slowly steadily plastic deformation till failure (Figure 4(a)). difference may caused different chemical compositions, fully indicate occurrence second strain hardening behaviour (Zhu et al.

Citation2018). Therefore, SLMed 304L SS maintain high strength high ductility even small number pore oxide inclusion reduce strength (Zhao et al. Citation2020; Zhu et al. Citation2020). AE characteristic parameter presented Figure 4(d) indicate almost microstructural damage failure. plastic deformation produced steadily regulation sub-grain structure decorated pre-existing dislocations. SLMed 304L SS lost internal structural stability instantaneously release dislocation energy storage caused strain hardening, resulting crack rapid deterioration. Figure 4.

Therefore, 55,000 previous cycle fatigue crack initiation dominate fatigue performance part (Pegues, Roach, Shamsaei Citation2020). Combined conclusion tensile tests, cycle assumed represent static tensile process extremely high strain rate. tensile process enter plastic deformation stage range elastic deformation stage Figure 4(a).The AE characteristic parameter fatigue test show excellent real-time monitoring ability internal damage reveal additional information (Zhang et al.

However, amplitude AE signal fatigue testing generally higher tensile testing, may due higher velocity dislocation motion extremely high strain rate. regular vibration crosshead fatigue loading may also influence increase AE amplitude.3.3. Texture twining tensile testingThe tensile sample selected two region EBSD observation, one close fracture slightly away fracture (Figure 5(a)). corresponding EBSD map (Figure 5) used analyze change crystallographic orientation comparing un-deformed EBSD map Figure 1(a-e). found strong deformation twinning formed area T1 area T2 (Figure 5(c, d, j)), indicates twin induced plasticity (TWIP) occurred tensile test (Rahman, Vorontsov, Dye Citation2015). area T2 closer fracture area T1, made twinning area T2 area T1 owing higher plastic deformation necking (Figure 5(a)). addition, excessive twinning slip caused excessive deformation reduced texture strength made crystallographic orientation random (Figure 5(i, l)). observing typical grain twin Figure 5(e, f), found Schmidt factor twin higher matrix grains, mean twin easier activate slip system matrix grains. Schmidt factor calculated X load direction (110) <111> slip system. According Figure 5(g, h), twin nucleated pre-existing dislocation around HAGBs, twinning controlled glide Shockley partial Burgers vector 1/6 <112> (111) plane (Gutierrez-Urrutia, Zaefferer, Raabe Citation2010; Rahman, Vorontsov, Dye Citation2015; Pham, Dovgyy, Hooper Citation2017a). addition, model proposed, is, twinning stress twin nucleation strongly proportional SFE metal (Romanov, Vladimirov, Nabarro Citation1992), (5) τtwin=γSFKbs(5) τtwin critical twining stress creating twin, γSF SFE (∼27.34 mJ/m2), K constant 2 determined (Romanov, Vladimirov, Nabarro Citation1992) b Burgers vector Shockley partial dislocation, 2.58 × 10−10 austenite phase (Pokharel et al.

SEM image fatigue fracture (Figure 6(S3)) show fatigue crack initiated top surface, machined polished. well-known typical crack propagation region typical instantaneous fracture region recognised Figure 6(S3). Therefore, fatigue resistance considered influenced surface quality premise ensuring low porosity part (Kasperovich Hausmann Citation2015). Additionally, necking found around instantaneous fracture region (boundaries marked yellow dashed line Figure 6(S3)), similar fracture surface tensile samples. large number large pore small number small pore distributed surface instantaneous fracture region (Figure 6(S3)). large irregular pore mainly lack-of-fusion (LoF) defect caused inadequate penetration molten pool (Darvish, Chen, Pasang Citation2016), small spherical pore gas pore formed due entrapment shielding gas alloy vapour inside molten pool (Yu et al. Citation2019). similar fracture surface found (Kuo et al. Citation2020; Zhang et al. Citation2021). pore become site stress concentration, thus affecting yield stress ductility (Kuo et al. Citation2020). Therefore, keyhole top surface usually become site fatigue crack initiation (Figure 6(S3)). post-treatment method eliminating keyhole surface parts, laser re-melting (Yu et al. Citation2019), may improve fatigue performance additively manufactured 304L SS. addition, high thermal gradient high cooling rate print process lead high residual tensile stress, shifting mean stress amplitude, thereby affecting fatigue crack initiation. However, residual stress limited effect fatigue performance additively manufactured part compared surface roughness internal porosity (Zhang et al. Citation2020b). Figure 6.

According previous study TWIP steel (Gutierrez-Urrutia, Zaefferer, Raabe Citation2010), twin stress usually le slip stress (KtwH−P≤KslipH−P), grain refinement micrometer range cannot inhibit twinning. Therefore, deformation twin generated activation multiple slip small plastic strain close yielding (Figure 6(a2, b2, c2)). selected region F4 F5 (Figure 6(d2, e2)) far away fracture surface, strain produced fatigue test small form twins. Therefore, fraction twin boundary decreased increase distance scanning area fracture surface (Figure 6(a4, b4, c4, d4, f4)). addition, study reveals twining fatigue testing affected necking. hysteresis loop strain amplitude response Figure 4(b, c), strain amplitude previous 55,000 cycle nearly unchanged ∼2.67%, last 600 cycle rise significantly ∼8%. Combined AE parameter plotted Figure 4(d), increasing strain amplitude lead sharp increase AE parameters, mean increase damage rate SLMed 304L SS. Consequently, range 55,000–55,600 cycle identified crack propagation instantaneous fracture shown Figure 6(S3), make strain amplitude increase form necking. demonstrated necking near fracture caused large strain amplitude, resulting twin F1 F2 F3, F4 F5. twin boundary (TB) fraction study much lower (Gao et al.

Therefore, active dislocation cell interior impeded absorbed pre-existing dislocation walls, thus increasing density GNDs cell wall significantly improving yield strength, consequently contributing excellent fatigue property enhancing resistance fatigue crack nucleation. However, due extremely high strain rate fatigue testing, true activity mobile dislocation much higher static tensile testing. continuously increasing energy active dislocation flow caused high strain rate cumulative cyclic loading may make mobile dislocation penetrate cellular boundary (Figure 8(b, c)). meantime, pre-existing dislocation allow obstructed dislocation flow across cellular wall play key role maintaining stable motion mobile dislocation fatigue testing. regulation process beneficial fatigue property cause cellular boundary migration, leading drastic change position, shape, size wall width cellular structure (Figure 8(b, c)).

Therefore, cellular structure significantly impact dislocation accumulation (GND density), leading work hardening behaviour additively manufactured parts. giving cyclic deformation, dislocation wall large local misorientation (GND density) formed due deformation migration cellular boundary dislocation penetration annihilation (Figure 9(g, k)). addition, strain rate hardening help sustain homogenous deformation delay strain localisation necking (Li et al.

However, difficult active dislocation break HAGBs extremely high GNDs. Since duration combination mechanism work hardening mechanism strain rate hardening cellular structure account fatigue history, regulation effect cell structure play key role enhancing fatigue performance. Then, increased strain, dislocation line formed deformation migration regulation progress cellular structure (Figure 10(d)), offer GNDs density effectively triggering twinning (Figure 10(e)). formation dislocation line also controlled slip system austenitic grain external force except regulation effect cellular structures. increase strain caused sustained fatigue loading, fatigue crack start nucleate, twin form along previously formed dislocation line expense stored energy dislocation line (Figure 10(e)). Moreover, second twin make first twin buckle, due interaction regulation effect cellular substructure blockage effect first twins. mechanism interaction interlaced twin cellular structure impede adjust dislocation motion, thus improving resistance fatigue cracking slightly increase fatigue life (the last 600 cycles) (Figure 10(f)).

Section 3.6, found molten pool boundary show high possibility fatigue crack initiation. area around molten pool boundary extremely high residual strain induced mismatched expansion/shrinkage SLM process, provides high interface energy high residual GB dislocation modulus HAGBs, making HAGBs around molten pool boundary become preferential site fatigue crack initiation. Inappropriate process parameter may lead unacceptable residual strain, thereby greatly reducing fatigue life additively manufactured parts.In addition, twin generated cyclic deformation, intergranular fatigue crack probability nucleation twin boundary (Li et al.

However, active dislocation penetrate cell wall cannot transfer GBs, pill-up HAGBs, thus consequently leading intergranular fatigue crack HAGBs increase cyclic deformation. cannot ignored higher interface energy higher residual dislocation HAGBs near molten pool boundary induced mismatched expansion/shrinkage contribute making HAGBs become preferential fatigue cracking site (Li et al.

Based experimental result analysis, key conclusion drawn follows. unique heterogeneous microstructures additively 304L SS low SFE significantly improve fatigue resistance regulating mobile dislocation motion cyclic deformation. whole fatigue history, heterogeneous microstructure show different working enhancement behaviour cyclic deformation stage. stage residual dislocation accumulation inducing fatigue crack initiation, mobile dislocation caused cyclic deformation constrained cellular boundary slightly penetrate cellular boundary due high strain rate. behaviour result migration cellular boundaries, formation dislocation lines, provide driving force formation subsequent interlaced twins. twin formation, combination cellular boundary, dislocation line, twin boundary, HAGBs tune active dislocation motion cyclic deformation, enhance resistance fatigue crack initiation.The intergranular fatigue cracking appears predominantly HAGBs around molten pool boundary rather twin induced cyclic deformation. mobile dislocation induced cyclic deformation cannot pill-up twin boundary coordination cellular dislocation structure dislocation lines. mobile dislocation cannot transferred HAGBs, eventually pill-up HAGBs cyclic loading. addition, high mismatched expansion/contraction molten pool boundary lead high interface energy high residual GB modulus HAGBs, making HAGBs around molten pool boundary become preferential site intergranular fatigue cracking.Cyclic deformation accumulation lead lattice rotation reduce preferential <110> texture strength as-built parts, resulting random texture.The outer grain ‘nested’ structure induced print process lower deformation resistance, may reduce fatigue property additively manufactured parts.This work systematically determined mechanism heterogeneous microstructure improve fatigue resistance, thoroughly investigated fatigue failure process additively manufactured austenitic stainless steels, deepened understanding excellent additive manufacturing technology. work suggests optimising process parameter SLM process adding additional post-processing used tune unique microstructure obtain desired fatigue property.AcknowledgmentsThe work supported National Natural Science Foundation China (grant number 52075087), Fundamental Research Funds Central Universities (grant number N2003006), National Natural Science Foundation China (grant number U1708254).

However, coal one main fuel source power plant inexpensive, also regarded primary source carbon dioxide emissions.[1] Due low cost, coal generates 41 pct world’s electricity.[2] higher CO2 emission major concern coal-operated power plant creates several environmental issue like global warming. Hence, CO2 emission controlled plant better prospect mankind. increase efficiency power plant one key factor CO2 emission minimized. Advanced Ultra-Supercritical (AUSC) power plant development meet demand higher efficiency (more 45 pct) low CO2 emissions. best possible way achieve higher efficiency raise temperature steam inlet.[3] power plant's efficiency improves 0.5 pct 10 °C increase input temperature.[4] AUSC power plant considered operated temperature 700 °C pressure 350 bar.[5] this, various superalloys heat-resistant steel better creep strength oxidation resistance currently, utilized material developed result operation steam high temperatures. new generation steel ferritic/martensitic grade (P91, P911 P92) austenitic grade (SS304H SS304L). superalloys developed operate high temperature power plant Inconel 617, Inconel 625, Inconel 740, Haynes 282 263.[5,6,7] new AUSC units, material prime interest advanced austenitic steel Ni-based superalloy. new generation steel AUSC unit designed work temperature 620 °C 650 °C, whilst Ni-based super alloy withstand temperature range 700 °C 760 °C.[8] superheater tubing header piping, Ni-based alloy used candidate material replacement Fe-based alloy[9] whilst austenitic steel mainly used fabricate moderately high-temperature section. Hence develop efficient cost-effective plant higher thermal efficiency, dissimilar metal welding (DMW) Inconel 617 alloy SS304L steel becomes essential.[10,11] SS304L steel exhibit excellent corrosion, oxidation resistance good creep strength also offer easy processing, favourable welding performance good impact toughness. Due presence high Cr content, steel also offer good corrosion oxidation resistance high temperature.[12,13]Inconel 617 alloy (UNS N06617: Ni–22Cr–9Mo–12Co–Al–Ti) Ni-based austenitic superalloy exceptional creep strength maximum service temperature 800 °C. solution annealed final stage production, hence solid solution strengthened good combination high-temperature oxidation resistance mechanical properties. property make attractive material high-temperature operating component power plant, nuclear, aerospace chemical industries.[14,15,16] Alloy 617 offer exceptional oxidation corrosion resistance temperature 1093 °C whilst high creep property temperature range 649 °C 1093 °C.[17] presence Mo Co alloy add solid solution strengthening whilst Cr Al alloy help enhance high-temperature corrosion oxidation resistance forming protective oxide layer Ni surface. Cr Mo present alloy also produce carbide impart precipitation hardening alloy.[18] carbide precipitate decorated along boundary austenite grain retard boundary movement contribute creep strength alloy. However, presence alloying element like Ni, Co, Mo Al make alloy expensive. Hence, minimize overall material cost, inexpensive material good mechanical property considered lower-risk section operating temperature lower 650 °C. good substitute Inconel 617 alloy would austenitic grade stainless steel (SS304L, SS304H AISI 310), common material resist temperature roughly 650 °C 680 °C.In AUSC boiler, Inconel 617 proposed high-temperature section like superheaters repeater operating temperature 700 °C whilst cheaper SS grade steel moderately high-temperature component operating temperature range 600 °C 680 °C. Hence dissimilar joining two material becomes indispensable AUSC programme improve structural integrity minimize overall cost. Gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) primarily used combine different grade material varying chemical compositions, thermos-physical characteristics, mechanical properties.[10,19,20,21,22] However, major problem faced GTAW selection filler metal base material different chemical composition thermal expansion coefficient result evolution residual stress across interface, formation unmixed zone, diffusion element across fusion line.[23,24,25,26,27] However, problem rectified extent selection Ni-based filler different composition help minimize diffusion element also formation unmixed zone.[28] However, segregation alloying element filler, actually added filler metal impart mechanical property creep strength weld metal, cause poor impact toughness, ductility dip cracking poor resistance hot cracking. GTAW joint dissimilar Inconel 617 310 SS plates, produced using different grade filler (IN617, IN82 310 SS) investigated Hosseini et al.[10] good combination tensile strength impact toughness observed IN617 filler. poor impact toughness multiple crack unmixed zone estimated 310 SS filler. dissimilar weldment IN617 SUS 304 H steel produced using GTAW process IN617 filler investigated microstructure characterization high-temperature stress-rupture property Pavan et al.[2] mechanical stress-rupture testing result showed joint formed IN617 filler qualified AUSC boiler application. Naffakh et al.[25] also studied GTAW joint 310 SS Inconel 657, produced using different grade Ni-based filler result obtained compared 310 SS filler. IN617 filler resulted formation dendritic microstructure showed higher tendency embrittlement. welded joint produced using 310 SS filler showed higher tendency hot cracking formation low melting phases. Inconel filler selected best filler obtain dissimilar weldment IN657 310 SS dissimilar weldment produced narrow solidification range le segregation alloying elements. another study, Naffakh et al.[29] studied weldability hot cracking susceptibility hot IN657 310 SS dissimilar weldment using Varestraint tests. result show welded joint produced using Inconel filler least 310 SS filler substantial susceptibility hot cracking. Mithilesh et al.[30] also observed Ni-based filler (IN625) suitable choice producing sound joint Inconel 625 SS304L steel. different investigation dissimilar joint made IN617 P92 steel, IN617 filler generated highest level strength smallest amount residual stresses, thus deemed best filler.[31,32] making dissimilar GTAW joint IN718 310 SS, IN82 filler recommended produced optimum impact toughness highest corrosion potential.[33] However, difficult eliminate problem related multi-pass welding, formation unmixed zone, diffusion elements, inferior mechanical property due element segregation residual stresses.In recent, application laser beam electron beam increased significantly welding similar dissimilar metal alloy produce narrow heat-affected zone, le distortion, high cooling speed, good quality mechanical property concentrated heat high-power density.[34,35,36] problem related elemental diffusion across interface inferior mechanical property weldment also rectified extent using laser electron beam welding process.[24,37,38,39] Explosive welding also successfully implemented dissimilar welding titanium/stainless steel.[40] Shamanian[37] performed structure-properties investigation dissimilar electron beam weldment Inconel 617/310SS optimized welding parameters. test result showed poor inferior mechanical property weldment base metals. Ramkumar et al.[41] also worked characterizing microstructure mechanical property relationship electron beam welded dissimilar joint Inconel 625 austenitic Inconel alloy UNS 32205. tensile test study welded joint indicated failure weld metal attributed alloying element segregation weld metal. impact property also obtained poor base metal due segregation alloying particles. electron beam welding optimized welding parameter also performed making dissimilar weldment IN625 304L SS.[42] heterogeneous microstructure evolution weld metal observed due localized cooling effect. Zhou et al.[43] attempted use laser beam welding combine two different metals, Inconel SS grade steel. Bhanu et al.[44] extensively reported dissimilar joint P91 steel Incoloy 800HT developed laser beam welding reported deformity microstructure due keyhole effect. Li et al.[45] studied welded joint IN625 SUS 304 produced using high-power CO2 laser. fracture initiation occurred within weld metal tensile tested specimen. impact test result also produced inferior toughness value BMs attributed Nb Mo segregation weld metal.The literature study suggests dissimilar welded joint produced using GTAW process subjected several issue including selection filler metal. However, autogenous laser electron beam welding process face issue employed successfully make dissimilar joint plate thickness 12 mm. literature review also indicates limited research performed dissimilar joining, characterization mechanical testing Inconel alloy austenitic grade SS. research found related Inconel 617/304L SS laser beam weld AUSC boiler applications. current work performed fill research gap examine microstructure-mechanical property relationship laser beam welded dissimilar Inconel 617/304L SS weldments.2 Materials MethodsThe initial plate commercial grade IN617 alloy elemental weight pct (0.07 pct C, 0.5 pct Si, 0.5 pct Mn, 22 pct Cr, 12.5 pct Co, 9.0 pct Mo, 1.2 pct Al, 0.3 pct Ti, 1.5 pct Fe, balance Ni) austenitic grade 304L SS steel composition weight pct (0.018 pct C, 1.12 pct Mn, 8.06 pct Ni, 0.42 pct Si, 18.05 pct Cr, 0.024 pct P, 0.011 pct S, balance Fe), machined dimension 110 mm × 55 mm × 10 mm, employed, using laser power source, create dissimilar weldments. as-received base plate observed mechanical property given Table I.[24,32,46,47]Table Mechanical PropertiesFull size tableThe edge plate machined shaper grinded using grinding machine end polished using SiC emery paper. welding, cleaning plate done using acetone remove rust dust particle surface. schematic image base plate utilized joint preparation presented Figure 1(a). continuous diode laser (Laser line LDF6000-30 Diode Laser) used perform welding experiment. prepare joint, laser power welding speed 6 kW 1 m/min, respectively.[48] laser beam size 175 mm whilst focus maintained 0.2 mm.

IntroductionFriction Stir Welding (FSW), invented early 1991 Thomas coworkers Welding Institute (TWI) UK [1], many advantage conventional fusion welding methods. primarily due controlled low heat input, le heat affected zone (HAZ) degradation, le sensitization corrosion reduced thermal distortion well residual stress [2,3]. Remote welding capability environment friendly nature FSW provide specific advantage fusion welding respect many industrial application [2]. rotating tool non-consumable, harder material plunged traversed along abutting surface order join workpiece materials. Frictional heat, generated tool rotation, result formation plasticized zone around tool pin facilitates material flow form joint. advanced joining method involve melting workpiece joined, thereby producing weld wrought microstructure.Based idea, FSW considered effective way repair defect metallic structure [[4], [5], [6], [7]]. extended use friction stirring process, Thomas et al. proposed abutting face crack also joined together order perform repair component [4]. Various form crack aluminum alloys, e.g. full thickness, partially penetrating either weld zone, heat affected zone parent material, proposed repaired using FSW. Application FSW repair technique crack-sensitive aerospace material also proposed Arbegast Hartley [5]. Subsequently, crack repair crack mitigation metal matrix composites, ferrous non-ferrous alloys, superalloys added list material viable damage repair FSW route [6]. Further, possible application FSW damage repair got extended nuclear application laboratory scale investigation healing simulated crack stainless steel (SS) plates. simulated crack SS plate replicate corrosion irradiation induced damage formed stainless structure used nuclear industry [7,8]. FSW based damage repair technique believed potential used wide range industries, e.g. aviation, shipbuilding, nuclear, oil gas. Thus, crack repair accomplished carrying FSW along pre-existing crack metallic structure. Application FSW predominant joining/repairing material like aluminum, magnesium, copper alloy [9]. due lower strength melting temperature metallic systems, pose le restriction term temperature, stress abrasion resistance tool material. high strength melting point, FSW steel need performed high temperature. necessitates use sophisticated tool material withstand higher stress, temperature abrasion resistance stirring operation. advent new tool technology, FSW steel started gaining considerable interest making viable joining ferrous alloy [8,[10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]].Although FSW considered viable, sacrosanct method repairing damage (in connection advanced method like laser assisted spot welding, cold spraying etc.), fundamental study carried explore ability FSW heal crack austenitic stainless steel. expected contribute relevant information database future implementation FSW based damage repair technology industrial scale. Generally, 304L austenitic stainless steel considered one widely used material structural application various industry like chemical, nuclear, food processing, petrochemical etc. corrosive service environment related factors, 304L SS structures, often, develop crack despite resistance corrosion high temperature degradation, leading significant problem integrity maintenance structure. present work aim understand effectiveness FSW technique heal crack 304L SS plate using approach based process-microstructure-mechanical property correlations. much research work carried crack reparability austenitic SS FSW route. Ross et al. [7] studied application friction stir processing repair surface crack induced simulated corrosion environment 25 mm thick 304L SS plates. Gunter et al. investigated FSW-based crack repair 12-mm thick 304L SS system using high traverse speed (50–150 mm/min), weld power crack linearly tapered geometry [8]. current study, FSW performed lower traverse speed (25.4 mm/min) simulated crack straight geometry (in form wire cut straight slots) 12.7-mm thick 304L SS plate using unique temperature-controlled algorithm keep tool temperature constant FSW. fundamental study geared toward highlighting feasibility FSW damage repairing SS plate support detailed microstructural characterization mechanical testing.2.

Fixed weld temperature achieved varying FSW tool rotation rate using feedback mechanism, user-specified weld power. PNNL worked extensively developing fine-tuning control parameter (proportional–integral–derivative PID constants) ensure steady weld temperature (maximum diversion noted < 1 °C specified weld temperature). Two tool temperatures, 725 °C 825 °C, used. fixed weld temperature would ensure welded material exposed one fixed thermal boundary condition, thus microstructural evolution along length weld would remain predictable.Table 2.

SZ bounded thermo-mechanically affected zone (TMAZ) heat affected zone (HAZ) advancing retreating side. Significant grain refinement took place SZ due dynamic recrystallization (DRX) occurring severe plastic deformation result stirring operation. transition SZ HAZ TMAZ sharper advancing side retreating side common FSW joint [5,6]. attributed difference material flow two side [[28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33]]. Marker experiment FSW Al alloy showed material extruded shoulder rotation advancing side remains unmixed plastic deformation [30]. differential flow behavior partly contributes sharp interface advancing side. Also, material retreating side stirred opposing tool translation rotation direction resulting wider diffuse interface [34,35]. Another approach explaining difference according thermal/flow model [33]. shown advancing side TMAZ, flow material occurs clockwise manner flow current intermix towards central ‘dead zone’ resulting sharper interface advancing side. retreating side is, however, seen flow across TMAZ upward current crisscross downward current forming diffused interface [33].Download : Download high-res image (1MB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 6. Montage microstructures across various zone 304L SS FSWed a) 725 °C b) 825 °C (A – Advancing, R – Retreating).Although previous study showed clear flow line present SZ FSW different steel [[10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]] discussion thereof, presence flow line clearly visible FSWed sample study (Fig. 6). also known ‘onion rings’ quite common FSWed microstructures Al. close observation Fig. 6 render onion ring expanded occupy whole SZ. Rather, predominantly found lower part SZ material flow governed rotation tool pin. Also, onion ring found form advancing side SZ. ring spacing decrease one move away center towards TMAZ interface. Formation onion ring explained many researcher [[36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47]]. common idea FSW process, sheared material extruded around rotating tool pin layered manner retreating advancing side trailing edge tool. Also, rotational velocity layer differs evident ‘pin breaking’ experiment [44]. layered flow, intermixing several layer governed tool rotation rate and/or traverse speed. case 725 °C SZ, lower tool rotation speed allow extruded layer intermix thoroughly leaving unmixed layer giving rise number onion rings, shown Fig. 6a. onion ring also spanned wider area 725 °C SZ stir zone. Unlike this, 825 °C SZ underwent stirring due increased tool rotation rate leaving behind le number ring spanning shorter region (Fig. 6b). increase tool rotation rate, mixing among extruded layer becomes easier leaving behind le number ring 825 °C SZ. Disappearance onion ring increased tool rotation speed also reported previous study [33,48,49]. absence onion ring top half SZ sample attributed intense material mixing driven tool shoulder rotation [37]. larger diameter, frictional heat generated shoulder driven SZ resulting material flux rigorous mixing bulk flow, unlike layered flow pin-driven SZ. Another comparison appearance onion ring two sample difference contrast 825 °C sample (Fig. 5b). According Krishan [36], material extruded behind pin retreating side, must residing air-filled cavity trailing edge. current study, oxidation extruded layer might taken place case 825 °C giving rise higher contrast onion ring 825 °C SZ. Presence oxide particle along arc onion ring reported case FSW dissimilar Al alloy [50,51].Presence spiral feature evident microstructures shown Fig. 6, commonly known ‘lazy S’. Unlike onion rings, ‘lazy S’ extends throughout stir zone mostly spanning crown towards root weld. appears interface two sides, advancing retreating, intermixed stirring operation [45,47]. ‘lazy S’ sample show two prominent interface branch top bottom branch correspond insufficient bonding material driven shoulder pin rotation, respectively. top branch interface end towards advancing side indicating material flow retreating side. also reported FSW Al alloy [45]. bottom branch, interface change side reach retreating side leaving arc-shaped interface towards weld root. interface arc observed merging onion ring predominantly 725 °C sample (Fig. 6a). number curved interface bottom branch 725 °C sample (Fig. 6a) compared 825 °C one (Fig. 6b). ‘Lazy S’ appears breaking oxide layer initially formed abutting surfaces. cause insufficient bonding stirring process leaving trace along vortex material flow case aluminum [[52], [53], [54], [55]]. EDS study ‘lazy S’ show presence Cr-rich carbide oxide particles. discussed detail next section. stirring process, brittle second phase particle likely played similar role oxide mentioned above. need study understand mechanism brittle phase formation impact material flow involved. Presence common flaw like voids, tunnel, porosity etc. found SZs current study highlighting potential FSW technique crack repair.3.2.2.

IntroductionPress-brake bending widely used metal forming process automobile, aircraft, shipbuilding industries. process adapted fabricate angles, channels, corrugation plastic deformation material take required geometry different die punch forces. Real-time monitoring manufacturing process using non-destructive sensor aid evaluating process intermediate stages. sensor used different type depend material properties, component size, testing conditions. Acoustic emission (AE) widely used non-destructive technique online process monitoring deformation characterization employing piezoelectric sensors. Acoustic emission transient elastic stress wave generated rapid release energy plastic deformation materials, friction/rubbing metal forming, die/tool wear, cracking. various AE parameter used material characterization forming process type AE waveform, peak amplitude, root mean square (RMS) voltage, counts, energy, etc., parameter correlated damage failure characteristic material (Ref 1, 2). review Dornfeld (Ref 1) described list possible detectable source acoustic emission various manufacturing processes. Jayakumar et al. (Ref 2) explored application acoustic emission technique online monitoring different forming process punch stretching, drawing, blanking, forging, machining, grinding. Mukhopadhyay et al. (Ref 3) monitored industrial hot forging process using acoustic emission technique. study could detect onset die filling, breakdown lubrication forging infer increase friction associated increased acoustic emission activity (Ref 3). turning grinding operations, acoustic emission source due plastic deformation tool wear monitored, differentiated waveform pattern frequency component analysis (Ref 4). Similarly, variation AE amplitude RMS voltage assisted crack detection deep drawing punch stretching process (Ref 5, 6). study demonstrate potential acoustic emission technique monitoring metal forming processes.In addition acoustic emission, non-uniform plastic deformation material forming cause elastic residual stress (RS) remain metal sample even final fabrication component (Ref 7, 8). Nevertheless, homogeneous deformation improves residual stress characteristic mechanical behavior material. Baek et al. (Ref 9) showed improvement axial residual stress characteristic due homogeneous deformation non-circular drawing pearlitic steel wire conventionally drawn wire. However, study reported higher magnitude stress due non-homogeneous deformation across wire. Likewise, RS may beneficial detrimental depending stress state compressive tensile, respectively. Residual stress influence product lifetime change product shape manufacturing (Ref 10,11,12). Evaluation stress state would prevent early failure components. Hence, advantageous know residual stress non-destructively either direct measurement fabrication adapting online monitoring technique reveal stress state indirectly. Furthermore, online monitoring facilitates determination product quality process efficiency. researcher attempted use acoustic emission technique correlate AE parameter measured residual stress.The measurement residual stress using AE carried first time ceramic variation acoustic emission rate loading unloading (Ref 13). Later on, acoustic emission technique explored predict correlate residual stress manufacturing metal components. Ahmed et al. (Ref 14) introduced various residual stress level using different welding sequence fabrication mild steel T-sections. estimated residual stress correlated monitored AE count energy bend loading T-sections. proposed welding sequence lower residual stress result lower average AE energy higher average AE count bending. However, study focus final stress state bending. Sedek et al. (Ref 15) studied steel underwent different plastic strain level tensile deformation suggested AE RMS convenient parameter monitoring mechanical stress relieving process. Tonshoff et al. (Ref 16) correlated AE RMS voltage residual stress different grinding speed ratios. study found linear relationship AE RMS voltage RS compressive stress region nonlinear relationship tensile stress region. However, research conducted predicting residual stress distribution component undergoing bending process employing finite element modeling (Ref 17,18,19). study find non-uniform distribution residual stress plastic strain occurs bend region, maximum stress observed center bent corner. another study, Weng White (Ref 20) reported surface strain higher lower strength material bent larger angle. above-cited study clearly show literature residual stress assessment using acoustic emission press-brake bending application limited. Hence, explore using AE technique (AET) assessing residual stress state, present investigation aim online bend monitoring SS 304L sheet various bend angle using AET, RS measurement bending x-ray diffraction method.Material Experimental MethodsMaterialThe chemical composition SS 304L material used press-brake bending given Table 1. room-temperature mechanical property obtained uniaxial tensile test performed strain rate 2.1 × 10-3 s-1 presented Table 2. addition mechanical properties, Lankford anisotropy parameter (r) along rolling direction (r0) transverse rolling direction (r90) determined per ASTM E517-19 standard (Ref 21) 11% uniaxial tensile elongation. obtained r0 r90 value 0.913 1.061, respectively. minimal difference r-values seen rolling transverse rolling direction, agrees earlier reported study (Ref 22).Table 1 Chemical composition (wt.%) SS 304 LFull size tableTable 2 Mechanical property SS 304 L room temperature strain rate 2.1×10-3 s-1Full size tablePress-Brake BendingSS 304 L sheet 3 mm thickness cut shear cutting method square piece 200 × 200 mm. square sheet 200 mm chosen AE sensor could placed close bending line hindered bending machine. rolling direction (RD) transverse rolling direction (TD) sample identified based ultrasonic shear wave velocity measurements.

Three different region clearly demarcated based magnitude AE RMS voltage marked I, II, III. region-I show low Vrms values, region-II high constant Vrms, followed region-III, wherein RMS voltage decreases. point region-II start also identified highest amplitude signal recorded bending (associated punch hitting sheet), shown Fig. 5b. amplitude represents significant voltage peak (Vp) AE signal waveform recorded threshold 40 dB.

Since clear demarcation bending stage observed AE activity, actual bending time variation various bend angle could estimated, would enable AE rate evaluation. Bending time calculated time difference point AE RMS voltage start decreasing (start region-III Fig. 5) first high amplitude AE event due initial punch hitting (region-II). evaluated AE measurements, duration bending time marked Fig. 5(a) double-sided arrow. Further, variation estimated bending time different bend angle two (longitudinal transverse) direction shown Fig. 7. decrease bending time observed increase bend angle. also noticed transverse bend always associated lesser AE activity lesser bending time longitudinal bend, due lower yield strength material transverse direction. bending machine, increase bend angle achieved larger punch travel, inherently show displacement (travel head) non-uniform due acceleration. Hence, reduction actual bending time estimated AE parameter higher bend angles.Fig. 7The variation estimated bending time bend angleFull size imageEvans (Ref 13) used difference predicted measured AE rate unloading ceramic reflect irreversible behavior proposed approach measure residual stress. However, study, correlate acoustic emission rate residual stress bending SS 304L, emission rate obtained dividing cumulative AE parameter bending time. Hence, new normalized AE parameter obtained dividing cumulative count energy estimated bending time, showing significant variation bend angle. normalized AE parameter signifies emission rate. variation normalized cumulative count energy shown Fig. 8(a b), respectively. normalized cumulative count energy increase 120° bend angle decrease 135°. observed linear relation AE parameter bend angle good agreement observation Genna et al.

However, bending angle reported small (0.24° 1.82°) since bending performed using laser power.Fig. 8The variation AE normalized cumulative (a) count (b) energyFull size imageThe observed increase AE bend angle influenced strain rate constraint deformation process (Ref 26, 27). strain rate (ė) affect dislocation density (ρ) average velocity dislocation (υ) linked following equation (Ref 7)$$\dot{e} = \rho b\upsilon$$ (2) b Burgers vector. deduced equation 2 increase strain rate increase mobile dislocation density, cause increased acoustic emission activity. Hence, observed increase emission bend angle (Fig. 8) attributed increased strain rate. Venkataraman et al.

According Eq. 3, frequency directly dependent strain rate whereas inversely related ρm d. present investigation, increment bend angle achieved applying higher force high strain rate deformation. prudent assume strain rate increase bend angle; hence, increase dislocation density expected. Therefore, frequency remaining unchanged bend angle attributed variation strain rate dislocation activity.The AE signal unloading region (Fig. 9c) continuous type dominant low-frequency component (≈ 100 kHz) lower magnitude compared hitting (Fig. 9a). observed lower signal frequency ≈ 100 kHz Fig. 9b c attributed influence dislocation pile-ups, Raj et al.

Even though variation magnitude stress along three measurement direction within ±50 MPa bend angles, clear variation longitudinal stress (ϕ=90°) increase bend angle observed. However, variation transverse stress bend angle substantial. noticed variation stress bend angle independent bending direction (longitudinal transverse bends). RS measured three orientation (Φ = 0°, 45°, 90°) un-deformed flat region sample lie range − 30 +30 MPa. Hence, observed variation residual stress bending (Fig. 10) attributed constrained deformation V-die, introducing non-uniform plastic strain accumulation microstructural variation bent regions. microstructural variation bend region metastable austenitic stainless steel include change grain structure phase transformation.

However, observed negative relation transverse RS FWHM associated geometric constraint imposed bending deformation (Ref 40).Fig. 14The correlation residual stress FWHM three measurement direction (the label indicate bend angles)Full size imageThe Influence Various Deformation Mechanisms AEDuring deformation metals, acoustic emission associated different mechanism like dislocation slip/glide, twinning, deformation-induced phase transformation (martensite material). complex nature polycrystal plasticity simultaneous occurrence heterogeneous dislocation dynamic microscopic scale introduce difficulty discriminating corresponding AE source influence AE activity. However, present investigation, increase AE bend angle influenced increased mobile dislocation density (Sect. 3.1.1). increase FWHM (due microstrain) bend angle (Fig. 12) support increase dislocation density due strain hardening. addition, AE generated bending associated strain-induced martensitic phase transformation occurs metastable austenitic SS304L (Sect. 3.1.2). formation martensite cause transformation strain due change crystal structure. Hence, combined effect non-uniform plastic deformation strain-induced martensitic transformation influence final state residual stress (Sect. 3.2.1).Further, material anisotropy influence acoustic emission plastic deformation. bend angles, value normalized AE, RS, martensite volume fraction, FWHM lower along TD. observation line higher r-value measured along TD, indicates lower strain hardening rate. Ahmadi et al. (Ref 22) showed increase martensite fraction bend angle study V-bending observed lower residual magnetic field along TD due anisotropy. Lebyodkin et al. (Ref 41) tried understand influence material anisotropy acoustic emission α-Ti. study could correlate three-stage work hardening behavior three-stage AE activity along RD. However, TD, intricate interpret correlate AE work hardening due onset multiple slip systems. Hence, systematic investigation required understand influence material anisotropy correlate complex plastic deformation mechanism various source AE activity.Correlation Acoustic Emission Parameter Residual StressBased result discussion presented thus far, variation acoustic emission rate bending post-bending residual stress show similar behavior bend angle.

IntroductionDissimilar joint metallurgically incompatible Fe Ti based alloy system unavoidable spent fuel reprocessing plant fast breeder reactor (FBR) [1]. advanced electrolytic dissolution process developed reprocessing spent fuel, concentrated nitric acid used main process medium various concentration temperature [2]. dissolver containing 11.5 nitric acid temperature higher 353 K, Ti Zr based alloy accepted structural material due exceptional corrosion resistance highly oxidizing medium [3]. Hence, Ti based alloy nominal composition Ti-5wt%Ta-1.8 wt%Nb chosen candidate structural material dissolver [1]. rest plant endurable service conditions, 304 L austenitic stainless steel (SS) suitable [[2], [3], [4]]. Fabricating joint Ti–5Ta–2Nb alloy 304 L SS meeting requirement microstructural stability, bond strength corrosion resistance challenge due tendency form brittle intermetallics interface. Further, studying interdiffusion phenomenon Fe/Ti based system technological importance since long term thermal integrity dissimilar joint dependent metallurgical interaction period time.In Fe–Ti binary system, maximum solubility Fe α-hcp Ti 0.035 at% 1123 K Ti γ-fcc Fe 0.8 at% 1423 K [5]. two intermetallic phase system: (a) nearly stoichiometric FeTi phase CsCl structure narrow homogeneity range 51.5–52.0 at% Ti (b) Fe2Ti Laves phase hexagonal MgZn2 structure containing 28.5–35 at% Ti 1473 K [5,6]. intermetallic phase hard (FeTi = ∼600 VHN Fe2Ti = ∼1000 VHN) brittle cause embrittlement issue service [7]. difficulty compounded multi-component alloy involved. Concentration gradient driven interdiffusion across weld interface result formation additional ternary phase intermetallic compound modified chemistry [8]. instance, interdiffusion across FeCr/Ti system temperature 873 K may lead formation (a) ternary Ti5Cr8Fe16 phase accommodate 49.9–72.1 at% Fe (b) (Fe,Cr)Ti phase containing 9 at% Cr (c) (Fe,Cr)2Ti phase enhanced solubility (up 59.1 at%) Cr [9]. Similarly Fe–Ni–Ti ternary system, (Fe,Ni)Ti phase reported Ti rich side containing 2–25.1 at% Ni Fe2Ti also considerable solubility Ni [10]. Fe–Ti–Nb, solubility Nb FeTi determined 6 at% temperature 1173 K, Fe2Nb Fe2Ti formed continuous Fe2(Nb,Ti) type solid solution [11]. isothermal heat treatment, Laves phase could accommodate Ta Nb form Fe2(Nb,Ta,Ti) type phase without change crystal structure [11]. Apart formation brittle phases, large difference coefficient thermal expansion base material (17–18 × 10−6 /K 304 L SS; 7.6 × 10−6 /K Ti–5Ta–2Nb) also important factor contributes reduction bond strength dissimilar joints.For joining Fe Ti based systems, solid state welding technique involve melting base material like diffusion bonding (DB), friction welding (FW) explosive cladding (EC) found suitable [[12], [13], [14], [15]].

Wu et al.[4] suggested Fe-Ti diffusion couples, formation undesirable phase suppressed (1) shortening hold time particular temperature heat treatment (2) introducing interlayer solid solubility Fe Ti. However, practical applications, joining dissimilar system using fusion welding technique (with without interlayers) proven ineffective. Hence, solid-state welding method used either brittle phase completely prevented forming isolated dispersed phase matrix (a) preventing melting base metals, (b) forming bond severe plastic deformation, (c) narrowing heat-affected zone, (d) using welding source high energy density. process successful joining Ti/Ti-based alloy SS briefly discussed below.Diffusion bonding, solid-state welding technique used extensively welding Ti SS. Diffusion-bonded commercially pure (cp) Ti 300 series SS[5,6] 17-4 precipitation hardened steel[7] posse sufficient bond strength due formation intermetallic phase like FeTi, Fe2Ti, Cr2Ti, NiTi, Ti2Ni, σ joint interface. Subsequently, vacuum brazing us relatively low pressure introduces low residual stress diffusion bonding used join Ti-Al-V Fe-18Cr-9Ni-Ti Ag-27Cu-4.6Ti interlayer.[8] Appropriate temperature–time window suggested avoid formation Cu-Ti-based intermetallic phase thereby achieve acceptable joint quality. Electron beam welding also successfully demonstrated laboratory scale specimen Cu-Ti, Cu-SS, Ti-Cu-304SS joints.[9] Even though intermetallic phase could fully avoided, distributed dispersed phase matrix thereby rendering crack-free joint especially Cu used interlayer.A solid-state welding technique effectively demonstrated fabrication large component dissimilar material combination like, example, Cu-SS, Ti-SS, Al-Cu, Mg-Al explosive cladding.[10–13] technique, upon detonation explosive, flier plate (material lower yield tensile strength) collides base plate creating jet wave traveling optimized detonation velocity 2 3 km/s (in subsonic range).[14] fluid-like motion metal help removing surface impurity contaminant leaving virgin surface bonding severe plastic deformation.[15–19] Akbari Mousavi et al.[20] explained detail experimental set required explosive cladding simulated pressure–time shear stress profiles, difficult obtain experiment using AUTODYN software. effect process parameter like explosive load ratio, stand-off distance, thickness interlayer waviness joint interface also well understood.[21–26]For explosive cladding cp-Ti 304 SS, optimum ‘collision velocity-explosive load ratio’ window proposed Akbari Mousavi et al.[27] Song et al.[28] systematically studied change microstructure distance interface Ti/SS clads. Consistent observation (similar well dissimilar) explosive clads follows: (1) increase hardness near interface, (2) formation vortex (due jet formation) interface, speculated contain intermetallic phases, (3) elongation grain detonation direction, (4) existence partially melted zone recrystallized grains, (5) extensive plastic deformation material resulting formation deformation twin non-equilibrium phases.[21–25]To remove residual stress bond zone improve ductility cp-Ti/304 SS explosive clads, stress relieving heat treatment suggested temperature range 823 K 923 K (550 °C 650 °C).[29] addition, fabrication large component explosive clads may require annealing temperature le 1273 K (1000 °C) hot rolling.[30] Thermal exposure subsequent cladding enhanced interdiffusion alloying element leading formation diffusion zone clad interface.[29–31] Type phase form due interdiffusion, distribution respect interface, thickness reaction zone influence shear strength bend ductility joints.To fabricate dissimilar joint α-β Ti-5 wt pct Ta-2 wt pct Nb alloy (TiTaNb) 304L SS, explosive cladding technique used authors’ laboratory. Detailed investigation ‘as received’ clads[32–35] led following significant observations: Hardness high (~375 VHN) near interface SS side compared base material (~200 VHN). Grains TiTaNb elongated detonation direction. Deformation-induced phase transformation occurred form α′(bcc) ε(hcp) martensite SS fcc phase TiTaNb side clad. Intermetallic phase present isolated pocket clad interface specifically vortices. High hardness presence non-equilibrium phase (especially martensite SS) joint interface indicated deterioration mechanical property ‘as received’ clad[35] undesirable. Hence suggested literature,[29,30] explosive clads heat treated attain acceptable microstructure adequate mechanical property.The aim present investigation study evolution interface microstructure explosive clads TiTaNb 304L SS exposure elevated temperature range 823 K 1073 K (550 °C 800 °C) various duration 1 20 hours.

Similarly diffusion Fe, β stabilizer TiTaNb stabilizes β phase Ti.[42] Due limited mutual solubility (S) Fe Ti [S α-FeTi = 1.88 at. pct 873 K (600 °C) α-TiFe = 0.055 at. pct 1063 K (790 °C)], intermetallic phase like FeTi Fe2Ti expected form clad interface. predicted Ti2Fe equilibrium phase binary Fe-Ti system.[40] However, multicomponent systems, phase may stabilized due additional solubility Cr Ni. Earlier reference [38] Ti2Fe suggested possibility Fe2Ti4O phase, oxygen arising free surface material (before bonding). Hence, corresponding region interpreted one marked original interface dissimilar joint. Confirmatory evidence could obtained predicted phase using XRD due low volume fraction. Yet presence intermetallic phase isolated pocket clad interface, similar observed ‘as received’ clads[35] cannot ruled out.Figure 14(a) show UTS value 304L SS remained high 623 MPa due presence deformation-induced phase large volume fraction lattice defects. Considerable fluctuation could seen UTS value close clad interface ~514 MPa obtained zone containing intermetallic phase addition β-Ti. value, however, comparable tensile strength base materials. either side zone, UTS value corresponding region containing α-Fe + α′ phase (1648 MPa) SS β-Ti (1800 MPa) TiTaNb remained extremely high. computed value comparable quoted literature dual phase (α + α′) steels[43] β-Ti alloys.[44]When heat treatment temperature–time increased 873 K (600 °C)-20 hours, dark zone relatively high hardness ~350 VHN formed parallel clad interface seen Figure 4(a). Computations indicated zone single phase (Figure 7(a)) containing Fe2Ti type intermetallic phase. two stable intermetallic compound reported form Fe-Ti system, i.e., ordered bcc-B2 type FeTi hexagonal Fe2Ti, latter expected form first due lower enthalpy formation (−27.2 ± 1.3 kJ/mol vis-à-vis −22.5 ± 1.4 kJ/mol).[45] Confirmation predicted phase like Fe2Ti, σ, Ti2Fe, FeTi (Figure 7(a)) based XRD analysis difficult due overlapping reflection various phase (Figure 8(a)). Presence δ-TiO peak due oxidation TiTaNb thermal exposure.With increase temperature duration thermal exposure, additional zone formed within reacted layer Ti-side interface observed Figure 4(b). Within lightly etched zone TiTaNb (Figure 4(b)), concentration β stabilizer like Fe, Cr, Ni higher (Figure 5(b)), computation confirmed stabilization high-temperature bcc phase Ti. Rate growth zone (identified ‘zone 6’) much higher zone 3 (dark zone discussed earlier) containing intermetallic phases. due faster diffusivity Fe, Ni, Cr β-Ti self diffusion considered anomalous behavior.[46] Nakajima Koiwa[47] established correlation diffusivity relative metallic radius justify faster diffusivity transition element term ‘atomic size effect’ leading interstitial-substitutional type diffusion mechanism β-Ti. Compared this, diffusion ordered intermetallic phase (in zone 3) extremely slow witnessed 6 7 order difference magnitude tracer diffusivity Fe FeTi β-Ti phases.[46]Exposure still higher temperature [1073 K (800 °C)-20 hours] led formation several additional zone interface (Figure 4(c)). zone identified correlation microstructure, microchemical composition, phase fraction computed using JMatPro®. implied change microstructure hardness, (Figure 4(c)) computed phase fraction (Figure 7(b)) 1073 K (800 °C)-20 hour sufficient complete reverse transformation non-equilibrium phase form stable γ α + β phase SS (zone 1) TiTaNb (zone 8), respectively. Zone 7 (Figures 4(c) 10) adjacent TiTaNb revealed basket weave (Widmanstatten) structure enhanced concentration Fe (Figures 5(c) 10(d)). concentration interdiffused β stabilizer low, high-temperature β phase underwent phase transformation cooling resulting formation ‘transformed β’ structure consisting plate α separated β within prior β grains. interface, following sequence phase formation speculated using JMatPro® (Figure 7(b)):$$ {\text{Zone}}\,5\, \to \,{\text{Zone}}\,4\, \to \,{\text{Zone}}\,3\, \to \,{\text{Zone}}\,2 $$ $$ {\text{Ti}}_{2} {\text{Fe}} + {\text{FeTi}} + \beta {\text{Ti}}\, \to \,{\text{Fe}}_{2} {\text{Ti}}\, \to \,\alpha {\text{Cr}} + {\text{Fe}}_{2} {\text{Ti}}\, \to \,\sigma + {\text{Fe}}_{2} {\text{Ti}} . $$ predicted microchemical composition (Table II) suggests following trend respect redistribution alloying elements: zone 5—the phase designated Ti2Fe considerable solubility Cr. may due formation Cr2Ti phase interdiffusion Cr eventually complete solid solubility Fe-Ti-based Laves phase.[48] Intermetallic FeTi solubility rest alloying elements, whereas Ta Ni segregated Laves phase β-Ti, respectively. Laves phase considered Fe2Ti zone 4 3 actually (Fe, Cr, Ni)2Ti. σ phase nil solubility Ti. various phase predicted form clad interface, confirmatory evidence could obtained detailed following paragraphs:Enhanced peak intensity (Figure 9(b)) 2θ = 40.1 deg observation individual peak 2θ = 44.58 deg confirmed formation Fe2Ti phase heat treatment clad 1073 K (800 °C) 20 hours. Moreover, appearance additional peak 2θ = 62.94 deg suggested formation FeTi phase. specimen extraction milling FIB-SEM, zone 3 (Figure 4(c)) observed highly vulnerable fracture. Analysis zone gave confirmatory diffraction evidence (Figure 11) presence intermetallic FeTi phase. addition, existence two-phase (Fe2Ti + FeTi) region clad interface also could established (Figure 12). EPMA elemental concentration profile (Figure 5(c)) showed Cr enrichment closer interface SS side corresponding zone 2 (Figure 4(c)). Diffusion Ti 304L SS reduce activity Cr, thereby setting local Cr activity gradient. would lead ‘uphill’ diffusion Cr form locally Cr-enriched regions. Computations predicted (Figure 7(b)) formation two-phase σ + Fe2Ti structure zone 2 predominantly present σ phase containing 50.4 pct Fe, 47.9 pct Cr, 1.7 pct Ni. Electron microscopy-based evidence (Figure 13) suggested two-phase γ + σ structure zone 2. Formation σ phase contemplated earlier diffusion-bonded joint Ti SS.[5]Based experimental observations, following sequence phase formation confirmed across explosive clad heat treatment 1073 K (800 °C) 20 hours:$$ \gamma {\text{Fe}}\, \to \,\gamma {\text{Fe}} + \sigma \, \to \,{\text{Fe}}_{2} {\text{Ti}} + {\text{FeTi}}\, \to \,\beta {\text{Ti}}\, \to \,(\beta + \alpha ){\text{Ti}}\,({\text{Widmanstatten}})\, \to \,(\beta + \alpha )Ti\,({\text{equiaxed}}) $$Differences identified computed experimental result regarding type phase present various zone explained follows: JMatPro® based calculation phase fraction assumed equilibrium condition, whereas actual formation phase may favored kinetically interdiffusion element across clad fabricated non-equilibrium conditions. also possible Ti-rich Laves phase bcc Cr could detected probably due extremely low volume fraction.After heat treatment 1073 K (800 °C) 20 hours, UTS value corresponding zone 2 containing intermetallic phase computed 212 MPa (Figure 14(c)). value agreed reported diffusion-bonded Ti-304SS joints.[6] Across zone 6 containing β-Ti phase, UTS value decreased gradually function distance interface, indirectly related change composition β phase. UTS TiTaNb found lowest among region clad making susceptible failure service.Based experimental evidence computed mole fraction phases, formation intermetallic phase understood unavoidable heat treatment explosive clads. Due formation graded microstructure across interface, differing phase fraction microchemical composition, direct correlation microstructure mechanical property difficult. However, methodology established estimate variation mechanical property across explosive clad help understanding direct effect individual zones. present work though JMatPro® based calculation considered influence composition, grain size, mole fraction various phase mechanical property, contributory factor like microstructure, presence lattice defects, existence local stress due difference thermal expansion various phase within multi phase region considered. However, computation useful narrow temperature regime suitable heat treatment explosive clads. Based present study, recommended restrict post cladding heat treatment temperature le equal 823 K (550 °C). Time heat treatment chosen judiciously form continuous single-phase intermetallic zone parallel clad interface.5 Conclusions 1. Heat treatment TiTaNb/304L SS explosive clads temperature 823 K (550 °C) 10 hour cause change interface microstructure microchemistry. 2. Increasing duration heat treatment 20 hour 823 K (550 °C) resulted formation zone containing Fe2Ti β-Ti phase clad interface. Formation zone detrimental bond strength, since UTS value zone comparable base materials. 3. Heat treatment 873 K (600 °C) beyond resulted formation different phase within diffusion zone, type phases, relative mole fraction, microchemical composition dictated heat treatment conditions. 4. Zone containing intermetallic phase understood weak link structure heat treatment temperature 973 K (700 °C). 5. 1073 K (800 °C), poor high-temperature mechanical property exhibited TiTaNb indicated possible shift region failure flier plate explosive clad. 6. Based experimental result JMatPro® based computations, maximum limit set post cladding heat treatment temperature restrict formation intermetallic phase isolated zone clad interface. ReferencesB.

Therefore, weld pool essentially determines performance welding characteristic final joint. Though experiments, seen weld pool go undersized depth come joint thick sections. Paton welding institute proposed apply covering oxide-flux surface thick-sectioned piecework made significant improvement depth welding, named Active-TIG [1]. Modenesi et al. [2] approved kind flux change weld pool increase penetration depth. Heiple Roper [3] gave two hypothesis effect, arc contraction inversion Marangoni flow due chemical change top layer melt. Marangoni flow driven unbalanced surface tension point top weld pool high gradient temperature distribution. Using mathematical simulations, Zhao et al. [4] demonstrated internal vortex pool formed surface tension effects. Beside presence high-temperature gradients, variation surface tension sulphur oxygen content also reported originate intense thermo-capillary flow alters direction circulation weld pool [5]. A-TIG, Li et al. [6] reported narrow deep weld pool shape inward Marangoni flow. Li et al. [7] found surface tension reach maximum value increasing thickness flux coating. Wang et al. [8] conducted coupled modelling weld pool plasma arc TIG A-TIG equal amount heat input both, implying deeper pool effect arc. investigation revealed inversion Marangoni flow likely mechanism increasing penetration depth A-TIG joints. mathematical modelling, Zhao et al. [4] predicted effect oxygen content flow pattern intensity melt circulation pool. Berthier et al. [9] also demonstrated effect different activating oxide-flux weld pool via two-dimensional axisymmetric simulation. Although Active-TIG shown promising result aiming enhanced penetration, application prone shortages. Vidyarthy Dwivedi [10] reviewed issue A-TIG. oxide particle covering flux may immersed (plunged) molten pool trapped weld line [11]. Since entrapped particle turn site crack nucleation, facilitate fracture degrade mechanical property joint form lower resistance fatigue, tensile strength elongation. knowledge movement flux particle within pool would assist improve quality weld. Based SEM metallographic images, Feyzi [12] measured surface fraction, diameter number density oxide particles. Aucott et al. [11] used synchrotron X-ray imaging capture, visualize quantify situ melt pool evolution real metallic alloys. indicated occurrence surface turbulent flow drag small oxide particle pool. also confirmed suggested mechanism change shape fusion zone, pointing changing steel composition low sulphur high sulphur change flow direction also increase flow velocity melt pool dimensions.Modelling welding process deal description multiphase fluid flow, heat transport, mass transport, arc electromagnetics, phase change, thermodynamics, kinetics movement free-floating particles. example, Jaidi Dutta [13] conducted simulation concentrating flow phenomenon welding pool. another attempt, Yushchenko et al. [14] modelled heat flow magnetohydrodynamic effect stationary arc. Multiphase model capable handling coupled transport liquid, solid floating particles, referring Eulerian-Eulerian approach [15]. metallurgical system however, effect particle movement flow field neglected frequently, oxide particle small volume densities, respect system dimension melt properties. Therefore, particle motion regularly simplified uncoupled Eulerian-Lagrangian approach metallurgical process [16], i.e. fluid flow, assumed undisturbed particles, simulated first place, equation motion used solid particles, e.g. Stokes law, calculate path within flow field. important aspect drag force experienced particle, depends particle morphology, fluid viscosity local relative velocity particle respect fluid flow [17]. Another issue simulation A-TIG welding deal modelling surface tension–driven flow. Marangoni effect described sharp shear stress free surface fluid, attention drawn shallow layer fluid top surface. Modelling boundary layer beneath surface may demand fine grid spacing much modelling attempt catch real velocity profile [18]. Furthermore, coupled together solidification/melting phase change model considers mushy flow near wall weld pool. research, process A-TIG welding considered investigated weld pool geometry, temperature distribution, velocity field oxide particle motion path. Therefore, comprehensive numerical setup developed compute dependent variable consisting velocity, enthalpy, temperature solid-liquid fraction metallic system subsequently velocity position oxide particle function space time.2 Mathematical modelFully realistic modelling welding could extremely complicated, since involves multi-physics related plasma arc, radiations, material evolutions, chemical reactions, weld pool dynamic magnetohydrodynamics, well transport phenomenon heat, mass, momentum electric charge [19]. paper, however, focused objective current study, investigate distribution oxide particle within A-TIG weld pool. thus reasonable outline simplify problem assumption much main effect remained related objective.

Marangoni effect frequently applied boundary condition, used Wang et al. [8]. However, thermosolutal Marangoni boundary layer demand fine grid spacing much modelling attempt find accurate velocity profile mentioned Pop et al.

Thus, horizontal vortex shown Fig. 5a would hold particle surface prevent immersed pool perhaps. presence Marangoni effect however, high thermal gradient concentric surface tension gradient ∂γ/∂T > 0 top, upper film atom surface experience asymmetric tension accelerate toward hot point.

Marangoni magnetohydrodynamic effect main contribution form flow field shape welding pool A-TIG, Marangoni force two time influential electromagnetic force. main feature flow pattern predicted two vortices, one front another back arc location. bigger stronger vortex back, velocity reached ~ 0.2 m/s vertical direction arc, promotes depth-to-width ratio cause particle entrapment however. 3. Based simulation results, increasing electric current TIG welding showed lateral expansion weld pool enhance depth-to-width ratio. However, A-TIG, 33% increase current predicted give 14% increase depth-to-width ratio. Welding speed effectively changed size pool TIG, A-TIG, changed size also altered form pool, i.e. increasing speed A-TIG shift aspect ratio angle welding pool toward form TIG. Therefore, might critical limit welding speed A-TIG process beyond depth-to-width ratio would declined requirement welding practice could degraded TIG-like performance. 4. Numerical result trajectory oxide particle showed particle often dragged, submerged entrapped weld pool. many particle released different position top surface, 70% trajectory ended deeper half cross section weld. somehow consistent previous metallographic observation Feyzi [12] distribution particle cross section A-TIG weld. 5. reason obtained distribution particle cross section thought function back vortex flow regime pool. back vortex pick particle big portion top surface behind arc, immerses pool delivers discharge lower half pool back wall. Near back wall solidification rate high, shrinkage flow drag particle dendritic wall grasp within mushy structure solidifying weld.

Jamasri, Ph.D 2010 | Tesis | S2 Teknik Mesin Abstrak File Pdf Serat ramus (Boehmeria Nivea Linn) merupakan salah satu jenis serat alam yang memiliki kekuatan tinggi dan telah dimanfaatkan sebagai penguat dalam komposit dengan matriks polimer. Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah mengetahui ketebalan optimal panel komposit epoksi-ramie sebagai panel tahan peluru level II standar NIJ dan mengetahui pengaruh penambahan Stainless Steel Screen Mesh pada komposit hybrid epoksi yang diperkuat anyaman ramie dan Stainless Steel Screen Mesh terhadap ketahanan tembak peluru level II standar NIJ, kekuatan tarik dan kekuatan impak. Serat ramus direndam dalam larutan 5% wt NaOH selama 2 jam. Serat ramus kemudian dibentuk lamina dengan cara ditenun untuk mempertahankan orientasi serat. Matriks yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah epoksi Bakelite dan hardener Versamide 140 dengan perbadingan 1:1. Panel komposit dibuat dalam fraksi volume serat optimal yaitu vf â‰ˆ60% Pembuatan komposit dilakukan dengan metode hand lay yang dilanjutkan dengan metode cetak tekan. Langkah awal untuk menentukan ketebalan optimal komposit epoksi yang diperkuat anyaman ramie adalah dengan melakukan pengujian tembak pada panel komposit yang diperkuat dengan variasi jumlah lamina yaitu 12, 14, dan 16 lamina ramie. Langkah selanjutnya adalah mengurangi 4 lamina ramus kemudian diganti dengan variasi penambahan 4 stainless steel screen mesh sampai berat komposit hybrid epoksi rami-stainless steel screen mesh tidak melebihi komposit epoksi ramus dengan ketebalan optimal sebagai panel tahan peluru level II standar NIJ. Hasil pengujian tembak menunjukkan bahwa panel komposit yang diperkuat 14 lamina ramus dan memiliki ketebalan 23,20 mm merupakan ketebalan optimal komposit epoksi ramus sebagai panel tahan peluru level II standar NIJ, sedangkan hasil pengujian tembak panel komposit hybrid epoksi yang diperkuat dengan 10 lamina ramus dan variasi jumlah stainless steel screen mesh yaitu 4,8,12 lapis menunjukkan bahwa semua panel tidak mampu menahan penetrasi peluru dengan fenomena kegagalan tembus, pecah, dan delaminasi di bagian belakang panel. Hasil pengujian tarik menunjukkan bahwa kekuatan tarik mengalami peningkatan seiring penambahan stainless steel screen mesh, tetapi kekuatan tarik spesifik mengalami penurunan seiring penambahan stainless steel screen mesh, sedangkan hasil pengujian impak menunjukkan bahwa kekuatan impak dan kekuatan impak spesifik mengalami peningkatan seiring penambahan stainless steel screen mesh.
