IntroductionDue superior corrosion resistance mechanical strength, 316 austenitic stainless steel used many industrial applications, including aerospace, automotive, marine, chemical industry [1], [2], [3]. casting, rolling forging traditionally employed manufacturing technology 316 austenitic stainless steel [4]. However, Metal Additive Manufacturing (MAM) advanced manufacturing technique involves building 3D metal part offering design flexibility reduced material waste compared traditional manufacturing method [5], [6], [7]. Among different MAM technologies, wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) using Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW), gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), plasma arc welding (PAW) etc. offer many advantages, including reduced feedstock equipment cost high deposition rate using solid, [8], [9], [10], [11] metal-cored [12] welding wires. Additionally, WAAM exceptionally cost-effective technique, especially compared additive manufacturing process use powder-based initial material LPBF [13]. process widely employed produce large-dimensional industrial stainless-steel component low cost [14], [15]. However, heat management WAAM process critical process since cyclic multiple heating/cooling layer-by-layer production inevitably produce thermal loading WAAM process, this, turn, may affect homogeneity microstructure corrosion property as-deposited component depending processing condition material system [16]. Therefore, need conduct investigation WAAM microstructure make direct comparison identify significant difference microstructures corrosion property conventional manufactured cast stainless steel parts.Many different deposition strategy offered experimental numerical study WAAM process control microstructural formation [17], [18]. effect cyclical temperature profile final structure investigated literature several research group using experimental measurements, welding simulations, artificial intelligence model [19], [20]. study showed heat transferred substrate conduction surrounding air convection radiation previous layer WAAM process. However, certain number layers, substrate reach thermal saturation, heat transfer weld area carried convection radiation. Therefore, interlayer dwell time layer corresponding temperature range mainly control microstructure hence resulting mechanical property due heat accumulation increased number layers. optimal interlayer dwell time material determined based previous experimental and/or numerical study [21].Early study WAAM-based 316 L austenitic stainless steel focused microstructural property since microstructural morphology susceptible intergranular corrosion as-deposited austenitic stainless steel component [22], [23]. well known forming thin passive Cr2O3-based metal oxide layer surface SS316L increase corrosion resistance preventing oxidation [24]. microstructure wire arc additively manufactured as-built 316 L exhibit δ-ferrite dendrite austenitic matrix. known δ-phase austenitic matrix strengthens cast part weld joints. sigma phase also observed microstructure along ferrite austenitic phase [25]. Chen et al. [22] found delta phase dissolved austenitic matrix, intermetallic sigma phase formed interface influence multiple thermal cycles. also reported delta phase also reduces segregation prevents hot cracking austenitic stainless steel [26]. Typically, 316 stainless steel low-carbon concentration preferred WAAM process prevent potential carbide formation. However, sample 600 950 °C, carbide sigma phase may form undesirable phase austenitic matrix. Rodriques et al. [26] observed delta phase austenitic matrix acted nucleation zone sigma phase in-situ experiment sample heat-treated 950 °C 2 h. sigma phase, knowingly, intermetallic tetragonal crystal structure increasing hardness structure decreasing corrosion resistance [27]. Sigma phase also degrades corrosion resistance austenitic phase consuming Mo Cr element [28]. Chen et al. [29] indicated heat treatment 1100 °C followed water quenching eliminate effect work hardening dissolving carbide sigma phase SS316 steel.The anisotropic microstructural formation another potential characteristic WAAM process due layered structure [23], [30]. Efforts made reduce directionality via tool path orientation. However, experimental study showed clear correlation tensile strength along building direction scanning direction as-deposited 316 L component [31], [32]. addition anisotropy as-deposited components, non-equilibrium solidification also affect microstructure corrosion behavior as-cast as-deposited 316 L samples. cooling regime transforming delta ferrite austenite solidification casting process controlled optimize amount delta ferrite [33]. Thus, microstructure as-cast 316 L stainless steel mainly composed austenite residual δ-ferrite [31]. However, higher cooling rate solidification WAAM process led finer microstructures resulting better mechanical property compared as-cast sample [30], [34], [35]. Therefore, experimental comparison WAAM cast part needed clarify influence cyclic heating-cooling casting corrosion resistance manufactured 316 stainless steel demonstrate capability WAAM technology.This study investigated first time microstructure, mechanical, wear corrosion behavior five different sample extracted as-cast as-deposited WAAM 316 austenitic stainless-steel sample compare characteristic behavior. Complimentary SEM analysis also performed unveil microstructural morphology distribution secondary phase impurity austenitic matrix. Additionally, study report effect heat treatment as-cast austenitic sample mechanical, wear, corrosion properties. Outcomes current study contribute experimentally assessing property as-cast as-deposited WAAM 316 samples.2.

IntroductionThe deformation [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6] failure [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12] mechanism low stacking fault energy (SFE) face- centered cubic (fcc) polycrystalline austenitic stainless steel (SS 316) monotonic tension cyclic loading ambient elevated temperature investigated quite extensively past. found crack nucleate various interface twin boundaries, grain boundaries, extrusion/intrusion slip band inclusion many austenitic stainless steel. appreciable amount research carried tailor microstructure using various severe plastic deformation process obtain nanostructured grain suppress slip band formation thereby improving fatigue crack propagation resistance SS 316 [13], [14], [15]. mentioned microstructural feature evolve progressive increase stress/strain depending operative mode deformation i.e, slip/twin, act nucleation site cracks.It well established deformation behavior face-centered cubic metal greatly affected slip dislocation stacking fault probability. Slip fcc lattice (1 1 1) plane cause dissociation perfect dislocation two Shockley partial dislocation: a02101¯→a0621¯1¯+a0611¯2¯and form planar array intrinsic stacking fault ABCAC⁞ABC (1 1 1) plane. Since, partial dislocation bounding stacking fault region lie slip plane, act glissile dislocation movement get restricted within faulted region. However, cross slip recombination partial dislocation occur, energy-intensive process low stacking fault energy material like SS 316. difficulty cross slip reduces ability material continue shape change plastic deformation slip alone. Therefore, comparatively early stage deformation, thin band fine deformation twin develop, often observed reasonably high-resolution microscope. However, deformation feature like dislocation substructure twin arising due activity perfect partial dislocation depend highly resolved shear stress along slip direction word orientation slip direction respect loading direction. wide variation dislocation substructure form cells, veins, labyrinth observed different grain orientation cyclic deformation fcc single crystal [16]. orientation dependent dislocation arrangement found responsible difference slope length saturation stress plateau different crystallographic direction different medium SFE fcc single crystal [16]. Similarly, twin nucleation twin growth also follows Schmid’s law hence deformation behavior due twin formation depends grain orientation [17]. found grain crystallographic direction 〈1 1 1〉 along tensile loading axis prone twinning compared 〈1 0 0〉 direction reported low SFE fcc TWIP steel [18]. While, twinning 〈1 0 0〉 grain occur higher strain due localized increase stress concentration neighboring grains, case, extrinsic stacking fault ESF (ABCA|C|BCABC) becomes source twin ABCA|CB|ABCA nucleation [19]. Thus, assumed orientation dependent microstructural defect analysis explain certain yet unaddressed issue like isotropic tensile anisotropic fatigue response observed polycrystalline cubic material bcc steel [20] fcc SS 316 [21] stress strain controlled cyclic loading. cyclic deformation cumulative effect localized deformation within individual grain leading failure prevalent. hand, case hexagonal systems, situation slightly different. anisotropy fatigue response found insignificant compared anisotropy tensile response observed hcp hot rolled Mg alloy [22] cold rolled annealed commercially pure Ti [23], [24].The characterization microstructural defect transmission electron microscope (TEM) provide information regarding particular microstructural defect focus, information obtained X-ray diffraction emphasizes statistical aspects. Moreover, due high penetration depth mm even cm range well high spatial resolution high energy synchrotron X-ray source, help extracting diffraction information large volume element along beam path resolve small microstructural inhomogeneties present deformed microstructure [25], [26].Combination TEM X-ray line profile analysis microstructural defect characterization used wide variety material subjected different deformation processes. instance, characterization dislocation cell structure using TEM along line profile analysis conventional synchrotron X-ray diffraction data carried fatigued MANET steel [27], ECAP deformed F138 steel [28], austenitic stainless steel [29] subjected surface mechanical attrition treatment, tensile deformed fcc (0 0 1) Ni [30] single crystal, cold rolled Cu-Nb nanolayered composite [31] ferrous lath martensite [32]. Also, technique developed carry in-situ straining material accompanied deformation texture measurement using neutron synchrotron X-ray source [33]. Detailed survey reveals orientation dependent microstructural defect analysis tension cyclic deformation understanding manifestation anisotropic tensile fatigue property SS 316 studied yet, consideration paramount importance practical purposes.In paper, hot rolled annealed sheet SS 316 subjected monotonic tension stress-controlled cyclic loading along two different orientation rolling direction 0 45-deg loading axis. monotonic tension cyclic deformation SS 316 different configuration density microstructural defect generated. Also, stacking fault appear deformation due low energy formation SS 316. So, dislocation stacking fault need characterized simultaneously specimen orientation order predict role deformation failure mechanism responsible anisotropic mechanical property. combination Synchrotron XRD EBSD analysis allow quantitative well qualitative estimation damage accumulation different level microstructural length scale obtained information would bridge microstructural length scale gap correlating macroscopic mechanics.2.

DiscussionDue low stacking fault energy ∼15 mJ/m2 [45], addition primary slip activity perfect dislocations, partial dislocation play significant role strain hardening mechanism plastic deformation face-centered cubic SS 316. Slip fcc lattice (1 1 1) plane lead formation two Shockley partial dislocation form stacking fault ABCAC⁞ABC (1 1 1) plane following dislocation dissociation reaction: a02101¯→a0621¯1¯+a06[11¯2¯]. (111¯) plane, a02011→a06112+a061¯21is dissociation reaction. glissile dislocation intersecting (1 1 1)-(111¯) plane interact form Frank partial dislocation sessile dislocation: a061¯21¯+a0611¯2→a06011, thus forming barrier dislocation glide also known Lomer – Cottrell barriers. Screw dislocation piled Lomer - Cottrell barrier cross slip slip plane hence Lomer - Cottrell barrier contribute much strain hardening. However, dislocation model proposed Cohen et al. [46] show dislocation reaction: a02011→a062¯11 (glissile Shockley partial) + a03111 (sessile Frank partial) possible due high stress present dislocation pile head lead formation stacking fault. Also, small number dislocation pile-up need split order completely twin crystal valid low stacking fault energy metal like SS 316. also shown stacking fault extrinsic type, grow 2–3 atomic distance thick twin boundaries, visible high-resolution microscope. deformation microstructure shown Fig. 8 Fig. 9 deformation twin tensile fatigue sample play significant role observed anisotropic fatigue response SS 316. However, twinning requires dislocation activity induced hence contribution dislocation activity observed anisotropic mechanical response needed understood first. Thus, statistical contribution geometrically necessary dislocation activity short range long range internal strain stress generation single grain polygrain level derived term dislocation density, micro-strain, stacking fault probability, grain boundary misorientation parameter correlated macroscopic anisotropic response tensile fatigue.4.1. Isotropic strain hardening responseThe strain hardening mechanism fcc single crystal tensile deformation consists three stages- easy slip, multiple slip, cross slip. However, polycrystalline material, order satisfy strain compatibility adjacent grain plastic deformation multiple slip cross slip occurs. ease cross slip depends SFE low SS 316, hence multiple slip twinning preferred mechanism. initial texture SS 316 rolled plate indicates alignment crystallographic direction 〈1 0 0〉 〈1 0 1〉 along loading direction 0 45-deg sample respectively. result show isotropic tensile property strain hardening response. mentioned earlier, deformation fcc SS 316 occurs due primary slip activity perfect dislocation (1 1 1) plane well stacking fault formation (1 1 1) plane, depending stress/strain condition orientation applied load respect crystallographic slip/twin direction. Considering initial Goss texture geometrical relation slip plane normal, slip direction loading direction found higher number active slip system equally stressed 0-deg orientation i.e, 8/12 (two primary, critical, conjugate cross) compared 45-deg orientation sample half number i.e, 4/12 (2 primary critical) equally stressed slip system calculated Table 5. Stacking fault (1 1 1) plane occurs grain orientation crystallographic direction 〈1 1 1〉 〈1 0 1〉 aligned along loading direction [18]. Whereas grain orientation 〈1 0 0〉 crystallographic direction aligned along loading direction formation stacking fault requires higher stress local rise stress concentration [18].Table 5. Number equally stressed slip system along 〈1 0 0〉 〈1 1 0〉 loading axis.Slip plane normalSlip directionLoading axisSchmid’s factor〈1 1 1〉〈1¯01〉〈1 0 0〉0.408〈1¯10〉0.408〈01¯1〉0〈11¯1〉〈1¯01〉0.408〈110〉0.408〈011〉0〈111¯〉〈101〉0.408〈011〉0〈1¯10〉0.408〈1¯11〉〈101〉0〈01¯1〉0.408〈110〉0.408〈1 1 1〉〈1¯01〉〈1 1 0〉0.408〈1¯10〉0〈01¯1〉0.408〈11¯1〉〈1¯01〉0〈110〉0〈011〉0〈111¯〉〈101〉0.408〈011〉0.408〈1¯10〉0〈1¯11〉〈101〉0〈01¯1〉0〈110〉0Due higher number equally stressed slip system SST0 plastic deformation proceeds via multiple slip activity orient initial Goss grain Copper orientation. However, dislocation glide multiple slip system lead rapid strain hardening SST0 cease dislocation activity twinning occurs dislocation pile-up probably mechanism proposed Cohen et al. [46]. Twinning help internal stress relaxation lowering strain hardening. hand, twinning lead grain refining convert low angle boundary high angle boundary increase strain phenomenon reported low SFE TWIP steel also [47]. Whereas tensile sample SST45, due le number equally stressed slip system, deformation initial Goss oriented grain rotate G/BT orientation instead Copper texture like SST0. higher stacking fault probability SST45 indicated Fig. 8d due strengthening G/BT texture component, lead higher volume fraction intersecting twin SST45 compared SST0. Thus, extent strain hardening produced dislocation activity multiple slip SST0 almost equivalent strain hardening produced formation deformation twin SST45. Thus, combined effect dislocation activity twinning SST0 SST45 lead almost isotropic strain hardening behavior tensile deformation.4.2. Anisotropic fatigue responseDuring strain controlled cyclic loading, orientation dependent dislocation structure formed. Formation various dislocation structure vein along 〈1 0 1〉, labyrinth along 〈0 0 1〉, persistent slip band (PSB) ladder 〈1 1 2〉, cell 〈1 1 1〉 found responsible anisotropic cyclic hardening/softening behavior fcc Cu single crystal [16]. increase strain amplitude, dislocation structure change vein cell structure via PSB ladder formation. Hence, dislocation cell structure formation energy-intensive process. Similar dislocation structure manifested stress-controlled cyclic loading too. Fatigue stress-controlled cyclic loading process, critical state cross slip activity promoted long-range internal stresses. Internal stress arise due intra-granular inter-granular stress subgrain boundaries. case SS 316, internal stress arises due polarized wall formation found Gaudin Feaugas [5].The high volume fraction low angle grain boundary SSR0 SSR45 compared corresponding tensile sample indicates formation dislocation substructure fatigue samples. Considering initial Goss texture Schmid factor calculation show 45-deg orientation four equally stressed slip system, thus SSR45 prone cross slip compared SSR0. could supported low density GND cube oriented grain SSR45, indicating dynamic recovery via cross slip. hand, SSR0 higher density GND cube oriented grain indicating planar slip multiple slip system. Multiple slip activity increase internal stress form backstress, relaxed induced twinning adjacent grain thus leading better accumulation strain higher number cycle hence longer fatigue life. SST45, activation cross slip suppresses twinning activity cross-slip energy-intensive process cannot continue deformation stress-controlled cyclic mode hence, SSR45 exhibit shorter fatigue life.4.3. Evolution microstrain tensile fatigueThe overall macro-strain achieved failure showed close correspondence micro-strain case tensile sample SST0 SST45, however, different fatigue sample SSR0 SSR45. sake simplicity, consider macroscopic specimen composite consist periodic array hard dislocation cell wall soft channels. long-range internal strain (micro-strain) polycrystal level elastic strain cell wall plastic strain channel whereas macro-strain plastic strain cell wall channel [48]. However, composite model work explaining tensile deformation behavior. increase strain tensile deformation, dislocation arrangement change isolated dislocation dislocation forest structure tangle within individual grain shear band polycrystal level. macroscopic strain depends activation slip/twin system leading stable dislocation arrangement. microstrain {0 0 1} found higher {1 0 1} SST0 SST45 Fig. 9c, indicating different amount linear lattice strain arising different dislocation arrangement. However, misorientation parameter Fig. 9d Fig. 9e, {1 0 1} found higher {0 0 1} SST0 situation exactly reversed SST45. Thus, strain incompatibility {0 0 1} {1 0 1} arising due slip activity adjusted lattice rotation via twinning activity one plane. Thus, SST0 SST45 show isotropic tensile ductility.On hand, fatigue sample storage dislocation form well-defined dislocation cell dislocation free region bounded high dislocation density occurs [5]. According composite model, measured micro-strain near fracture region tested sample actually plastic strain channel depends dislocation density cell wall almost SSR0 SSR45 indicated Fig. 9c. Whereas, macrostrain sum total plastic strain cell wall channel plastic strain cell wall depends relative slip activity. discussion, clear SSR0 undergoes plastic deformation multiple slip whereas SSR45 cross slip activity predominant. Fig. 9c show extent lattice strain generated due dislocation activity almost SSR0 SSR45, however, lattice rotation much lower case SSR45 compared SSR0. SSR0 local backstress generated due dislocation dislocation cell wall induce twinning. Twinning cause lattice reorientation relaxes backstress help accumulation higher amount fatigue strain. While, case SSR45 due cross slip activity, twinning suppressed leading lower fatigue strain accumulation.The role twinning tensile ductility fatigue strain could understood context microstrain- macrostrain relation observed case commercially pure titanium tensile fatigue deformation behavior [49]. Ti, twin formed tensile cyclic deformation found thick multi-variant nature [24]. Twins basically partition single crystal contribute polycrystalline deformation required macro-strain generation.4.4. Orientation dependent failure mechanismFracture feature shown Fig. 10 broadly reveals transgranular ductile fracture failure mechanism common SS 316. also clear mechanism crack nucleation crack propagation leading final failure different SST0 SST45, although exhibit isotropic tensile property. discussed earlier, SST0 plastic deformation mainly governed multiple slip activity, whereas SST45 twinning predominant deformation mode. Thus, SST0 easy crack nucleation take place site dislocation pile-ups transgranular crack propagation take place along definite crystallographic planes. However, SST0 higher crack propagation resistance evident presence secondary crack fracture surface shown Fig. 10. hand, SST45 twin boundary/grain matrix interface act crack nucleation site crack nucleation resistance appreciably high. Due higher twinning activity transition copper brass texture component take place SST45 strong latent hardening effect slip system non-coplanar active twin plane [40]. However, crystal plasticity based modeling strain hardening behavior low SFE fcc metal Kalidindi et al. [50] proposes reduction copper texture component due microscale shear band formation. apparent contrast opinion regarding reduction copper texture component due length scale deformation microstructure considered investigation. Basically, mechanism get manifested different microstructural scale appears different features. Due formation microscale shear band follow definite crystallographic plane, cause coalesces microvoids leading coarse dimple feature, reduces crack propagation resistance. Thus, although crack propagation path distinctly different SST0 SST45, however, failure occurs almost stress-strain values.As evident Fig. 9a b, cyclic deformation lead formation soft cube oriented grains. SSR0, due higher multiple slip activity, cube grain high GND density hence crack nucleation difficult crack nucleates twin boundary/grain matrix interface crack propagation intersecting twin also difficult. induced twinning SSR0 lead formation shear band microcracks fast crack growth region indicated Fig. 11. SSR45, due cross slip activity amount soft cube grain fragment low GND density, crack nucleation resistance lower SSR0 also, due lower volume fraction twin le resistance crack propagation. undergoes partial quasi-cleavage fracture identified tear ridge fracture surface responsible early failure SSR45 compared SSR0.5. ConclusionsThe present investigation lead following conclusions•The cumulative effect dislocation density twinning strengthens G/B texture component SST45 thus leading strain hardening tensile ductility comparable SSR0.•Although crack propagation path distinctly different SST0 SST45 crack propagation resistance failure tensile load same.•Higher dislocation density increase stacking fault probability SSR0 induces twinning 〈1 0 1〉||ND help reducing backstress increase micro-strain accumulation capacity 〈0 0 1〉||ND SSR0 compared SSR45.•The appearance soft cube grain orientation due cross slip activity reduces crack propagation resistance SSR45 responsible shorter fatigue life compared SSR0.AcknowledgementThe author would like thank Department Science Technology funding INSPIRE faculty fellowship Dr. Atasi Ghosh (research grant no.

Extreme plastic deformation make possible combine dissimilar similar material without melting workpiece. melting occurs, friction welding solid-state welding technology relate fusion welding process. method different intermetallic bonding/compound intermetallic compound formed electropositive electronegative metal chemically bond form compound specific composition crystalline structure.Friction welding minimizes likelihood welding failure influence material small surface area, hence reducing stresses, flaws, material loss [1]. Friction welding minor effect heat-affected zone heat generated friction melting point base metal [2] low residual strain deformation [3,4]. approach also allows connecting similar differing material quality [5,6,7] consumes le electricity conventional electric welding. benefit make FRW useful number application [1,8,9].Thereafter, several variety friction welding created, continuous direct drive friction welding [8,10,11], inertia-friction welding [12,13], linear friction welding [10,14,15], orbital friction welding [16,17]. Reviewing present research, several advantage downside methodology outlined analyzed. Continuous direct drive friction welding, usually referred rotary friction welding (RFW) linear friction welding (LFW), two prevalent friction welding processes. number metallic structural joint comparable dissimilar material successfully welded using RFW LFW. well-established procedure diverse application widely utilized link wide variety component [10,14,15].Reviewing present research, besides several advantage mentioned above, friction welding method still downside limitations, outlined analyzed. welding part need relatively large cross-sectional area due limited available power input spindle motor; therefore, welding thin-wall structure tube plate remains challenge. Moreover, process welding successful material least one component plastically deformable.The fundamental idea rotary friction welding separate two component welded one component held stationary push normal direction rub component rotating specified speed. general, friction pressure comprises two stages: friction stage, two material undergo increase temperature due friction, forging phase, consolidates weld. result hot work, flash produced grain structure polished contact interface. heat created interface joints.Researchers studying numerous factor influencing property friction welding joints, pressure friction time, pressure forging time, rotational speed, oscillation frequency, oscillation amplitude, friction pressure, correlation microstructure characterization, microhardness fluctuation, interfacial phase formation, optimal welding parameter mechanical property [1,10,18,19]. choice welding parameter significant impact manner heat generation material flow friction welding process, well microstructure, residual stress, structural integrity weld. influence parameter friction welding greatly dependent type material connected.The friction welding process accommodate wide range material complexity. application method distinct material yield particular effects. Researchers investigated property FRW weld center zone (WCZ), thermomechanically heat-affected zone (TMAZ), heat-affected zone (HAZ). certain material joints, WCZ area may undergo dynamic recrystallization (DRX), although occur TMAZ HAZ. another condition, dissimilar material joined, high temperature weld line combined severe deformation also likely promote formation intermetallic compound [10]. microstructure mechanical property zone highly dependent base material process condition [11].The effect process parameter quality connection, including mechanical qualities, microstructure, chemical properties, varies type material connected. Optimization process parameter always vital friction welding process. optimization friction welding parameters, materials’ weld quality increased; however, effect factor fully understood. optimization study yet completed.Friction welding employed developed production component automotive, power generation, aerospace, marine, oil sectors, nuclear systems, numerous engineering application [9,20,21,22,23] due advantages. example component apply friction welding include engine blade disks, cylinder tube hydraulic cylinders, drive shafts, pipe nozzles, drill pipes, marine engine valves, impeller turbo-supercharger diesel engine.Friction welding used connect variety related materials, including superalloys various steels, mild steel mild steel, stainless steel stainless steel, mild steel stainless steel [24,25], aluminum alloys, copper alloys, titanium alloy [7,26,27]. method also applied variety dissimilar material combinations, including aluminum magnesium alloy [13], pure aluminum copper [7], dissimilar steel alloys, superalloy-steel, steel-aluminum [6], tungsten-mild steel [28], tungsten aluminum alloy [29], aluminum-titanium [22], magnesium alloy stainless steel [30]. addition, FRW used link metal non-metallic material [11,31], including Al6061 alloy alumina-YSZ composite [32], steel ceramic [33], copper alumina [34]. Joining material using friction welding yielded different amount success advantages. make use benefit friction welding, therefore possible numerous researcher continue developing analyzing welding various sort diverse materials. addition, zinc relatively active metal whose compound stable. discovered considerably later le reactive metals, gold, copper, iron, silver, lead. However, found nature. Zinc typically regarded rather weak metal; but, alloyed stronger material subjected particular treatment, impact strength increased. Pure zinc tensile strength ranging 28 MPa (cast) 246 MPa (hard temper), elasticity modulus 70 MPa, melting point 419.5 °C, excellent corrosion-resistance [35]. According industry, zinc alloy employed variety ways. quality zinc also decide whether could used automotive, medical, construction purposes. creation product components, development production process zinc-based materials, including joining, issue.So far, zinc used interlayer material strengthen attachment friction stir welding dissimilar materials, interlayer Cu Al joints, whereby assisted Zn interlayer improved joint quality regulating interfacial microstructure [36,37,38]. Zn also used interlayer joint Al Steel, whereby lap joint zinc foil filler metal showed better strength joint without filler metal [39]. Friction welding also carried join Zn conductor [40]. However, utilization friction welding Zn metal yet known.This paper discussed friction welding stainless steel pure zinc. two material joined rotary friction welding. analysis focused effect friction time mechanical property friction welded 316 stainless steel pure zinc using direct continuous drive friction welding. investigation analyzed mechanical parameters, microstructure, material characterization also compared preheating effect friction welding method. 2.

Material combination good mechanical property superior corrosion resistance generally preferred equipment subjected heavy mechanical load severe environment like nuclear power plants. Among many nickel-based superalloys, Hastelloy C-276 considered best producing combination properties. Hence, C-276 widely preferred nuclear power plant application steam generator operating temperature could 600 °C [2, 3]. However, high cost, alternate material Haste alloy C-276 still employed wherever possible. Stainless steel (SS) may one alternate Hastelloy C-276, higher erosion resistance considerable mechanical property [3]. However, examination dissimilar joint nickel-based superalloys SS carried archived. investigate information accessible peculiar combination C-276 SS316 L considered widely. Additionally, super-critical water gas (SCWG) reactors, used convert biomass gaseous fuels, main reactor shell subjected harsh working condition like high temperatures, pressures, corrosive chemical environment. header nozzle joint shell channel joint reactor would need dissimilar weld joint [4, 5]. Hence, worthwhile study weld joint interface two dissimilar material like Hastelloy C-276 SS 316L made using different welding processes. result investigation useful many high-temperature applications.There many complication joining dissimilar material compared joining similar materials. One important issue joining two dissimilar material arises different chemical property [1, 3, 4]. Mostly, joining dissimilar weld metal fabricated using different arc welding process shielded metal arc welding (SMAW), gas metal arc welding (GMAW) gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) [5, 6]. Among different welding technique GTAW especially preferred join dissimilar material [7, 8], since facilitates joining material non-consumable electrode, cost-effective time saving.Dokme et al. 2018 [9] joined dissimilar metal Inconel 625 AISI 316L using continuous current gas tungsten arc welding (CCGTAW) pulsed current gas tungsten arc welding (PCGTAW) process using different filler material like ERNiCr-3, TIG 316L twisted (ERNiCr-3 TIG 316L). Authors reported PCGTAW welded sample twisted filler produced sound mechanical property. Earlier, Sharma et al. 2017 [10] joined Hastelloy AISI 321 austenitic stainless steel using ERNiCrMo-4 filler GTAW PCGTAW. author concluded compared CCGTAW joint PCGTAW joint resulted sharp weld bead, fine grains, le elemental segregation, higher ultimate tensile strength. Pandit et al. 2014 [11] studied joining dissimilar weldment Monel 400 Hastelloy C276 GTAW process ERNiCrMo-3 filler wire. author reported quality weld zone higher compared parent metals. Sharma et al. 2018 [12] reported dissimilar joint superalloy C-276/stabilized grade 321 using PCGTAW process microstructure show columnar cellular dendritic structure higher heat input weldment revealed lower heat input weldment show equiaxed cellular dendritic structure.. Ramesh Kumar et al. 2011 [13] welded dissimilar SS 304 316 using TIG, laser, electron beam welding, author characterized welded joint using NDT techniques. Mishra et al. 2014 [14] studied tensile strength MIG TIG welded dissimilar joint mild steel stainless steel. tensile result revealed TIG-welded dissimilar joint sound mechanical property compared MIG welded joints. Taraphdar et al. 2020 [15] studied intergranular stress corrosion cracking AISI 304L stainless steel analyzed temperature history two different groove design conventional narrow groove. Pandey et al. 2018 [16] studied microstructure evolution P91 steel weldments. Author concluded initial microstructure play important role deciding mechanical property P91 steel. Sirohi et al. 2020 [17] investigated microstructure mechanical behavior dissimilar welded joint martensitic 335-grade P91 steel high alloy ferritic austenitic 182 F69 steel produced GTAW process. Author concluded tensile strength dissimilar welded joint high as-welded condition reduced PWHT. Pandey et al. 2017 [18] investigated dissimilar weld joint P91 P92 steel joint made using autogenous TIG welding single pass, double side pas multi-pass GTA welding filler wire. Author concluded peak hardness poor impact toughness observed autogenous TIG weld joint compared GTA welds.From extensive literature review, observed author reported joining Hastelloy C276 Ni-base superalloy austenitic stainless steel SS316L using GTAW. Hence, investigation, attempt made fabricate dissimilar joint Hastelloy C276 austenitic stainless steel SS316L using GTAW.

Taguchi technique applied optimizing selected welding parameter welding current (I), welding voltage (V) powder feed rate (PFR). L9 orthogonal array selected according aforementioned factor three level experimental test performed. Signal-to-noise (SN) ratio used evaluate experimental results. result indicate welding voltage greatest infiuence tensile & impact strength welding current significant factor hardness.KurzfassungFür die Verbindung von 316-Edelstahl-Platten wurden die Prozessparameter de Plasma-Pulver-Auftragsschweißens optimiert, um geschweißte Werkstücke mit maximaler Zugfestigkeit, Schlagzähigkeit und Härte herzustellen. Dabei wurde die Taguchi-Technik angewendet, um die ausgewählten Schweißparameter wie Schweißstromstärke (I), Schweißspannung (V) und die Pulverzufuhr (PFR) zu optimieren. Es wurde ein L9 orthogonales Feld gewählt, bezogen auf die vorgenannten Faktoren mit drei Ebenen und experimentelle Untersuchungen wurden durchgeführt. Mittels der Signal-Rausch-Verhältnisse wurden die experimentellen Ergebnisse evaluiert. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, das die Schweißspannung den größten Einfluss auf Zugfestigkeit und Schlagzähigkeit hat, während die Schweißstromstärke für die Härte von Bedeutung ist.Keywords: Plasma transferred arc welding; Taguchi; stainless steel; optimization; propertiesSchlüsselwörter: Plasma-Pulver-Auftragsschweißen; Taguchi; rostfreier Stahl; Optimierung; EigenschaftenReferences1.

IntroductionAISI stainless steel (SS316), particular grade Austenitic Stainless Steel(ASS), stand superior corrosion, radiation resistance, robust mechanical property elevated temperatures. property make suitable high-strength structure high-pressure temperature applications, pressurized water nuclear reactor [1–4]. addition standard industrial applications, SS316 also preferred medical, pharmaceutical, food processing due ability maintain weld integrity, rust-free qualities, ease sensitization [5]. also completely recyclable, making sustainable environmentally friendly choice various applications. result, SS316 steel alloy become material choice wide range industrial product subjected high temperature pressures, jet engine parts, heat exchangers, evaporators, tanks, oil industry, submarine [6–8].The robust property SS316 due alloying element including carbon(0.08%), silicon(0.75%), chromium(16%–18%), nickel(10%–14%), molybdenum(2%–3%), nitrogen(0.1%) [9]. Carbon increase strength reduces intergranular corrosion resistance high temperature due carbide formation [10], chromium imparts corrosion resistance forming thin layer chromium oxide surface reacts oxygen. However, chromium react carbon high temperature form chromium carbides, reducing corrosion resistance [11]. Nickel help stabilize austenitic microstructure room low temperatures, molybdenum increase resistance pitting caused certain acid improves heat wear resistance [12]. Manganese nitrogen improve machinability, decrease brittleness, enhance flow strength corrosion resistance [13].A passive oxide film formed surface SS316, make stainless protects rusting. film refractory material, high melting point welding process make challenging achieve qualified weld joint. requires high level focused heat input remove it, lead weld burn-through prevent complete joint penetration. scenario, technique required ensures precise heat input control high-quality weld cost-effective. Plasma arc welding (PAW) emerged viable option joining thin structure SS316 due ability produce concentrated arc small heat-affected zone (HAZ). reduces risk weld defect minimizes spread heat input material due focused arc, reducing likelihood weld burn-through. Additionally, PAW offer comparable weld quality laser electron beam welding advanced manufacturing thin structures, relatively lower cost.During welding SS316 alloy, PAW maintains quality weldment using keyhole mode generates sharp, focused, high-velocity, high-temperature plasma beam capable removing thin, invisible, corrosive film formed reaction chromium molybdenum oxygen sample surface [14]. Figure 1 show schematic keyhole mode PAW. process, constricted concentrated plasma arc generated tungsten electrode narrow orifice constraint nozzle, surrounded shielding gas nozzle protect arc fusion zone environment [15]. resulting plasma-based heat input used welding sample plates. welding technique preferred produce narrow bead weld minimal thermal effect base material due concentrated plasma beam.Zoom Zoom Reset image size Figure 1. schematic micrographic diagram Keyhole mode plasma arc welding. Adapted [15], permission AIP Publishing.Download figure:Standard image High-resolution image high heat concentration penetrate joint single pass, removing passive oxide film contaminant producing sound weld [16–18]. However, conventional welding techniques, including PAW, generate high thermal energy welding, leading undesirable residual stress welded structures. stress negatively impact material property welded structures, corrosion resistance, fatigue strength, distortion [18, 19]. Keyhole plasma arc welding dynamically controlled low stress distortion (DCLSND) mode introduced address issues. mode minimizes high heat input welding, reducing associated residual stresses, improving microstructure mechanical property welded structure. One widely adopted technique DCLSND welding trailing cryogenic cooling medium welding process reduce weld-induced stresses.Cryogenic cooling effective reducing residual stress welding processes. National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA), part Saturn program, first demonstrated significance cryogenic cooling welding aluminum airframes, showing alleviate warpage residual stresses, initial experimental investigation found use cryogenic liquid auxiliary heat led 5% decrease residual stress [20]. However, mechanism behind reduction understood, mathematical model existed explain cooling process. Therefore, first 2D model analyze effect heat sink thermal capacity distance welding variable plasma arc process introduced, model overpredicted effects, indicating need 3D model [21]. Thus, 3D ellipsoidal model welding heat input developed, led introduction dynamically controlled low stress distortion (DC-LSND) welding technique applied non-linear non-regular welds, eliminated distortion, investigation needed understand mechanism control [22]. Toward end, first simulation study conducted, used liquid nitrogen(LN2) study effect cryogenic cooling hot cracking welds, found increase standoff distance led increase hot cracking [23]. Based result limitation previous studies, last two decades, thorough investigation mechanism behind reduction welding residual buckling stress due cryogenic cooling conducted. result found use trailing heat sink increasing cooling strength decreasing distance welding arc eliminate buckling distortion thin plates, also revealed significant reduction occurred longitudinal stress stainless steel(SS) material using LN2 coolant [24, 25]. similar study investigated effect coolant flow rates, revealing certain threshold coolant flow rate achieved, cooling intensity increase [26]. combination GTAW LN2 trailing variable distance behind welding arc (DW) investigated, result revealed reduction longitudinal stress out-of-plane distortion [27].In past years, numerous study examined effect trailing cryogenic coolant fixed distance behind welding arc various aspect welding, including temperature distribution, residual stresses, weld distortion. Techniques Friction Stir Welding (FSW) [28], Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) [29–31] tested various cryogenic cooling mediums, including liquid nitrogen (LN2) liquid carbon dioxide (LCO2). study found cryogenic cooling reduce distortion residual stresses, increase tensile property microhardness, improve grain size welded joints. In-process cooling also found enhance grain size mechanical property [32], CO2 gas effective post-weld coolant reducing residual stress [33]. contrast planar welds, SS316 circumferential weld quality evaluated examine effect LN2 impingement Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW), result revealed notable reduction weld distortion enhancing delta ferrite content SS 316 [34]. Additionally, cryogenic treatment found reduce residual stresses, refine microstructure, increase impact strength Tig welding AISI 304 laser beam (LW) electron beam (EBW) weld [35]. However, case dissimilar welding Al 6061-T6 mild steel using FSW, high-strength weld joint produced using water trailing coolant, trailing LN2 resulted lowest tensile shear strength lap joint [36].A detailed summary recent study trailing cryogenic cooling welding processes, discussed above, presented table 1. seen although various study investigated potential benefit cryogenic cooling weld quality thin structure different welding technique implementation PAW DCLSND mode yet investigated. Therefore, innovative aspect current study use trailing LN2 combination PAW explored weld quality 2 mm thin SS316 sheets. per author's knowledge, study examined PAW conjunction trailing LN2 heat sink. effectiveness LN2 cryogenic cooling validated based analysis microstructure mechanical property weld samples.

IntroductionLaser beam welding (LBW) carried help various type laser like CO2 laser, Nd:YAG Laser, diode laser, fiber laser, Q-switched. Various grade stainless steel (SS) like AISI 304, 316, 316L, 321, 416 autogenously laser welded small 10 µm thickness [1]. Dissimilar welding ferrous well nonferrous material successfully implemented without filler materials. autogenous LBW, laser parameter like laser power, beam incident angle, pulse duration, welding speed proved affecting weld microstructure apart material properties. new approach making vent hole LBW galvanized steel also found successful eliminate defect Zn vaporization [6]. Thus use Laser proving best solution welding sub-millimeter thickness sheets. Stainless steel (SS) one important ferrous material used numerous application typical property like corrosion resistance, light weight, higher surface finish, etc. 150 grade stainless steel available. variant wide application automotive, aerospace, construction, kitchen utensils, even electronics industry also. emergence micro-technology, become necessary harness best quality offered ferrous material micro-technology, also true stainless steel variant ferrous materials. Conventional welding sub-millimeter thick stainless steel suffered various disadvantage like thermal distortion, hot cracking, corrosion susceptibility, heat affected zone, etc. hence laser welding steel gaining importance every day.Researchers attempted study effect various laser parameter weld quality stainless steel sheets. Ventrella et al., [2] demonstrated successful welding 100 µm AISI 316 SS foil 1.75 J energy welding speed 525 mm/min using pulsed Nd:YAG laser 4 m pulse duration. increase laser power increase weld depth welding stainless steel sheet [2], [3], [4].The role laser beam incident angle laser micro-welding studied Yu Liao [5]. Yu Liao also studied change characteristic length weld bead pulse mode [5]. also study done find optimum welding speed welding different stainless steel higher productivity [1], [3], [4], [6]. Microstructural analysis also done study effect weld quality. Ventrella et al., [2] analyzed heat affected zone (HAZ) laser welded AISI 316L SS foil 100 µm thickness showed increase pulse energy increases. Ventrella et al., [2] also observed lower pulse energy, provided complete penetration occurs, higher tensile property welded joints. Molian P’ng [6] compared laser beam welding resistance seam welding found former process exhibited 25% tensile shear strength latter. Welding dissimilar material done get advantage two different material properties. example welding SS brass, high corrosion resistance offered SS; simultaneously hardness strength improved Zn present brass [7]. difference physical property dissimilar material bring difficulty welding process. Huang et al., [8] studied dissimilar laser micro-welding Pt-10 PctIr 316 SS address difference joint morphology joint breaking force (JBF) increasing laser power. observed material orientation along temperature gradient material property must considered welding dissimilar crossed wire laser. Acceptable weld platinum alloy SS wire obtained SS wire subjected incident laser beam.The literature survey laser beam welding sub-millimeter thick SS 316 stainless steel material show mainly pulse mode different type laser like Nd:YAG [2], [5], [6], Yb –Fiber Laser [1], diode laser [4] used. need study effect various laser system continuous mode also. many study concentrating either lap/spot welding [1], [2], [3], [5], [6], [9], [10] bead-on-plate welding [1], [4], [11], [12]. evidence study laser welding sub-millimeter thick SS 316 butt joint configuration done fiber laser literature review done far. Hence attempt made study laser welding butt joint configuration joining sub-millimeter thick sheet SS 316 help Yb-fiber laser continuous mode.2. Central composite designCentral composite design (CCD) widely used design experiment technique modeling welding process.

CCD welding experiment used RSM eventually used find optimum operating condition determine region factor space operating specification satisfied. CCD design gained popularity welding experiment relatively efficient respect number run required. Thus, run included CCD 8 factorial runs, 6 axial runs, though least one centre point. However, present study 6 centre point used making CCD 20 runs. CCD three input parameter five level consists standard first order design 8 orthogonal factorial point 6 center points, augmented 6 axial points. Thus total number experiment set CCD becomes 20 experiments. independent variable measurable, controllable, continuous experiments, response surface, expressed negligible error by:(1)y=f'xβ+εWhere, x = (x1, x2,….xk)f’(x) = vector function p elementsβ = vector p unknown constant coefficientsε = random experimental error assumed zero meanIn CCD, approximate model needed develop true response surface. approximated model constructed utilizing observed data welding process case. Multiple regression analysis used this. Usually, second- order polynomial equation used CCD, given by,(2)y=βo+∑i=1kβixi+∑∑βijxixj+∑i=1kβiixi2+εWhere, parameter β0, βi, βij, βii called regression coefficient = 0,1,…,k j = 0, 1…k.3.

Using varying size interface powder microwave joining SS-304 plate revealed grain size directly proportional mechanical strength inversely proportional size interfacing powder [14]. Further, microwave joined 21-4-N nitronic steel plate using nickel powder reported equiaxed grains, metallic carbide nitride grain boundary joint interface, tensile strength 61 % base metal, average microhardness 407 ± 69.27 HV [15].Joining dissimilar material (MS SS) using microwave energy resulted presence high carbon MS side SS side, tensile strength 346 MPa, elongation 13.58 % [16]. another study, MS SS joint SS interface powder reported joint dendritic structure weld region, hard intermetallic phase (FeNi, Cr23C6 & Cr7C3), tensile flexural strength 420 MPa 787.5 MPa, respectively [17].

Joint formation time predicted 14 min temperature graphite susceptor weld interface ∼1065 °C ∼966 °C, respectively [28]. Microwave joining SS-304 lap joint analysed nickel Inconel-718 interfacing powder simulation study [29]. Formation joint occurred 1320 higher temperature nickel interfacing powder (1470 °C) estimated due lower thermal electrical conductivity Inconel-718 (1404 °C) compared nickel.It evident literature limited effort reported simulation study SS-316L charcoal SiC susceptor.

IntroductionTokamak type nuclear fusion reactor work principle containing donut-shaped plasma within toroidal-shaped magnetic field [1]. Several experimental tokamak developed around world better understand science behind nuclear fusion-based energy generation. International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) France [2] SPARC reactor US [3] two notable program around world pursuit reaching break-even condition experiments. nuclear fusion-based energy generation technology would crucial entire world meet long-term planetary goal various climate change accord 2016 Paris Climate Agreement United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP) goal [4], [5].One crucial technology enable success nuclear fusion-based energy generation superconducting magnet system used contain control super-hot plasma. Internally cooled cable-in-conduit conductor (CICC), comprise wound coil superconducting material copper cable, utilized produce magnetic field tokamak [3], [6]. CICCs comprised electrical element (superconductors copper), cooling element (often form central cooling channel) structural element case made stainless steel. cryogenic fluid passed cable operation maintain superconductivity high current density passed generate strong magnetic field around [6].

Considering structural functional requirements, SS 316 LN Nitronic-50 (N50) two candidate material suitable jacket application posse strength magnetic property required cryogenic (4 K – 77 K) service temperature [14], [15]. key characteristic material ability retain austenitic γ-phase paramagnetic even cryogenic temperatures. high percentage nitrogen promotes stability γ-phase cryogenic temperature [16], [17]. current technique produce jacket involves compaction rolling fusion butt welding jacket section [18]. Fusion welding material investigation shown induce certain undesirable property materials, sensitization heat-affected zone (HAZ) evolution δ-ferrite weld nugget [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24]. δ-ferrite ferromagnetic phase would lead higher degree magnetization jacket material. magnetization interfere induced magnetic field internal coil lead issue containment plasma within tokamak [25].To address shortcoming fusion welding process, alternative approach adopted join section jacket together. One attempt made Decool et al. [12] utilized explosive bonding technique manufacture twin-boxes housed cables. technique would suitable single CICC assembly therefore set limitations. current study, friction stir welding (FSW) approach adopted join jacket section together form conduit house internal cable.To evaluate feasibility FSW join two candidate material – SS 316 LN N50 – series experiment characterization task carried out. first step involved design suitable FSW tool made using W-Re alloy. next step involved optimization welding parameter obtain full penetration weld without defects. subsequent step involved welding jacket section evaluation weld microstructural analysis.

Meanwhile, new reaction layer intermetallic compound layer formed joint interface. decrease hardness Zn alloy due thermal softening effect caused continuous heat friction.Previous article issueNext article issueKeywordsInertial friction weldingContinuous drive friction weldingWelding parametersTensile strengthThermal softening effectIntroductionFriction welding solid-state method generates heat mechanical friction workpiece surfaces, eliminating need external heat. applying external force, workpiece deforms plastically, making joining dissimilar similar material possible without melting them. contrast fusion welding, includes melting, friction welding solid-state process. distinct intermetallic bonding, occurs compound develop due chemical interaction electropositive electronegative metals, resulting particular composition crystalline structures.Friction welding reduces likelihood welding failure decrease material effect influencing limited surface area, resulting le stress, defects, material loss (Kumar Rajak et al., 2020). little influence heat-affected zone heat friction remains melting temperature base metals, resulting negligible residual stress deformation (Ananda Rao Ramanaiah, 2019; Nasution et al., 2015; Rafi et al., 2010). technique allows joining similar dissimilar material (Basmaci et al., 2020; Sathishkumar et al., 2023). benefit make friction welding useful variety application (Kumar Rajak et al., 2020; Nasution et al., 2022; Ramesh Kumar et al., 2023).Following that, several friction-welding technologies, including continuous direct drive friction welding (Li et al., 2016; Nasution et al., 2022), inertia-friction welding (Guo et al., 2017), linear friction welding (Matsuda et al., 2019), orbital friction welding (Raab et al., 2015), developed. Current research shown merit downside approaches, also evaluated (Ahmad Mir et al., 2022).Pressure, friction time, forging time, rotational speed, oscillation frequency, oscillation amplitude, friction pressure, relationship microstructure, microhardness, interfacial phase formation, optimal welding parameters, mechanical property extensively studied researchers. friction welding process, selecting parameter substantial impact heat production, material flow, microstructure, residual stress, weld integrity. effect parameter heavily influenced material connected.Friction welding technique successfully applied wide range material combinations, including aluminum-magnesium alloy (Guo et al., 2017), pure aluminum-copper (Pratyusha et al., 2021), various steel alloys, superalloy-steel composites, steel-aluminum composite (Basmaci et al., 2020), magnesium alloy-stainless steel (Nasution et al., 2019), stainless steel-zinc (Dahlan et al., 2023). Using friction welding joining material resulted various degree success advantages.Inertia friction welding (IFW) continuous-drive (direct-drive) friction welding (CDFW) two unique solid-state welding method vary operation weld properties. inertia friction welding, one workpiece held stationary rapidly rotated. momentum rotating workpiece creates relative motion. Firstly, rotating piece pushed specific pressure, friction, position rotating piece kept constant. rotating workpiece rub stationary workpiece, friction generates heat, softens material interface. friction force may decrease softening process.In direct-drive friction welding, one workpiece rotated certain speed stationary. relative motion created driving one workpiece directly. friction force kept constant continuous constant pressure. Heat generated continuous rotational motion one workpieces, maintains contact stationary workpiece. constant motion provides consistent heat source.CDFW IFW share comparable rotating friction welding process characteristics, differing mainly energy supply method (Kimura et al., 2020, 2017; Li et al., 2016). CDFW, energy rotation provided driving motor. Rotational speed, friction pressure, friction time, axial shortening, forging pressure, burn-off length key process control factor CDFW IFW (Ramesh et al., 2019). Optimizing friction welding parameter essential enhancing weld quality (Ramesh et al., 2019). optimization procedure largely reliant individual material used. Interlayer presence, interlayer thickness, geometric form modifications, diameter ratios, taper angles, cooling procedures, pre/post-weld heat treatment element lead enhanced joint quality (Basheer Mohd Noor, 2013; Cheepu Muthupandi, 2013; Dahlan et al., 2023; James Sudhish, 2016; Khany et al., 2015; Sahin, 2009).Additionally, zinc alloy used variety applications, number parameter determine appropriateness automotive, medical, construction applications. Moreover, using zinc biodegradable material interesting concept, researcher exploring strategy enhance application performance zinc context implant biodegradability (Kabir et al., 2021). Zinc alloy promising biodegradable metallic material clinical use (Hernández-Escobar et al., 2019; Zhuo et al., 2022).

Fracture appearance SS 316-Zn Alloy welded joint continuous drive method friction time 30 35 s.There two reason increasing friction time impact joint tensile strength. First, increased friction period likely lead intermetallic zone development along near friction contact. Second, greater friction periods, creation oxide film layer contact surface inhibits metallurgical bonding joint surface. Fig. 8(a) show brittle fracture surface Fig. 8(b), look ductile. Careful attention fracture morphology reveals surface almost flat, essentially evidence ductile fracture, shear lip (Fig. 8(a)). Meanwhile, Fig. 8(b) depicts fibrous fracture surface somewhat rough fracture appearance, indicating ductile fracture (Guo et al., 2023).ConclusionsContinuous-drive friction welding inertia friction welding used join SS 316 Zn alloy, optimal process parameter determined. optimal setting continuous-drive friction welding 9.5 kPa friction pressure, 9.5 kPa forging pressure, 35 friction duration, 16 mm burn-off length. greatest tensile strength produced parameter 60 MPa. Increased friction time increase formation oxide film layer, reduces interfacial bond strength. Increasing friction duration may increase number C element interface, causing interdiffusion process hampered. interdiffusion process significant may generate intermetallic phase required reinforce joint.Disclosure declarationThe funding source research provided Ministry Education, Culture, Research Technology Republic Indonesia (Grant No. 012/E5/PG.02.00.PL/2023), involve financial non-financial conflict interest. author aware approve process writing submitting articles.FundingThis research fully supported financially Basic Research Scheme contract number: 012E5PG.02.00.PL2023 Ministry Education, Culture, Research, Technology Republic Indonesia.CRediT authorship contribution statementHendery Dahlan: Investigation, Formal analysis, Conceptualization.

Numerically, Takahashi Tanimoto (1995) presented finite element (FE) simulation methodology SPW, good agreement observed simulation experimental result high-vacuum atmosphere. Iordachescu et al. (2009) analyzed butt cold welding process using FE method systematically focusing material flow hardening behavior. simulation found helpful process equipment design.Raising temperature proved able improve joining performance SPW. Eizadjou et al. (2009) carried SPW aluminum alloy strip reveals threshold deformation required bond formation decrease increase temperature. Mahabunphachai et al. (2009) also discover metal (e.g., stainless steel) joined elevated temperature. survey performed McQueen (2012) review fundamental knowledge developed regarding hot working applied various non-fusion welding methods. However, complex facility required industry realize high-speed heating workpiece SPW. low-cost, high efficiency heating method urgently required.An electrically assisted solid-state pressure welding process (ESPW) proposed tandem issue. Electric resistance heating promising method raising temperature metals. Mori et al. (2005) investigated hot stamping process steel sheet using resistance heating improve springback formability. time required conduct heating process workpiece 800 °C two second according experiments. Yanagimoto Izumi (2009) developed hot forming system combining forming machine electric resistance heating facility. system considered highly efficiency controllable forming high-alloy metal poor workability. Mai et al. (2011) found flow stress metal decrease increase current density due resistant heating electroplastic effect.

Moreover, average Schmid factor FCC phase deposited LHM-2 sample higher LHM-1 sample, indicating superior deformation capability FCC phase LHM-2 sample. also aligns experimental results. Notably, following tensile deformation, average Schmid factor FCC phase LHM sample decreased, BCC phase increased. implies post-deformation, FCC phase became harder deform, BCC phase becomes easier. finding rarely reported previous studies. Combining Fig. 16(i-l), observed even tensile deformation, significant number substructural grain recrystallized grain still existed within BCC phase LHM sample sets, suggesting BCC phase retained deformation capabilities. hypothesized tensile process, BCC phase slipped direction conducive deformation.

IntroductionIn recent years, DOE focused fuel cell technology mean achieve efficient reliable form energy conversion. Fuel cell seem show promise towards achieving goal. fuel cell electrochemical device, efficiently convert chemical energy fuel directly electrical energy without combustion. fuel derivative higher order hydrocarbon (i.e. H2, CH3OH, CH4). 1839, fuel cell invented William Grove. Since then, fuel cell attractive due high energy converting efficiency nearly zero emission. Fuel cell research mainly focused alternative energy source battery internal combustion engine. comparison battery, fuel cell inexhaustible work long fuel supplied, whereas battery exhaustible need replaced time. Several issue fuel cell component cost, weight, properties, performance fuel cell environment fuel storage need resolved advantage fuel cell exploited.Fuel cell classified different group based components, function applications. Among these, DMFC PEMFC used low temperature applications. DMFC work liquid methanol unlike PEMFC us H2, thereby eliminates on-board H2 storage problem. result, risk explosion use fuel cell eliminated. Liquid methanol suitable storage. DMFC considered economical, fuel (liquid methanol) recycled external humidification avoided. places, DMFC work without external parasitic loss work capillary action, buoyancy diffusion processes. electrochemical reaction involved DMFC given follows [1].Anode reaction:CH3OH+H2O→CO2+6H++6e−E1∘=0.016V/SHECathode reaction:32O2+6H++6e−→3H2OE2∘=1.229V/SHEOverall reaction:CH3OH+32O2→CO2+2H2OEeq∘=1.21VΔH0=−726kJ(exothermic reaction)where refers standard hydrogen electrode.The challenge efficient DMFC performance include: (1) methanol crossover; (2) slow chemical kinetics; (3) carbon dioxide production anode; (4) poisoning catalyst [2], [3]. effect problem reduced improving certain component like bipolar/end plate material design, membrane electrode assembly (MEA) catalyst loading.Bipolar/end plate important costliest component fuel cell. component alone constitutes 80–85% total weight cell stack. called end plate single stack function bipolar plate multi-stack fuel cell flow field design side plate. bipolar plate act separator plate two cell keep methanol oxygen direct contact. intricate flow field design bipolar/end plate distributes fuel (liquid methanol oxygen) uniformly reaction surface. material property intricate flow field design bipolar/end plate play vital role efficiency DMFC. per target DOE, bipolar plate material fuel cell must low cost (<10US$ kW−1), low weight (<1 kg kW−1 system), corrosion resistant (<16 μA cm−2), highly conductive (>100 cm−1) impermeable (<2 × 10−6 cm3 cm−2 s) [4]. perfect flow field design distribute liquid methanol oxygen gas uniformly anode cathode reaction surfaces, respectively. electrochemical reaction occurs DMFC exothermic produce heat reaction. design efficiently remove heat produced chemical reaction, avoiding local build heat. anode reaction DMFC byproduct, CO2, inhibits motion methanol flow field. lead significant reduction active area reduces overall performance fuel cell stack. efficiency flow field design also influenced permeability fuel bipolar/end plate material. Material low permeability fuel give better performance fuel cell environment increase pressure drop across flow field. increase pressure drop contact fuel interface change diffusion process convective process interface [5], [6]. result, fuel cell give better performance.Graphite currently used commercial bipolar/end plate material. poor mechanical properties, increase machining cost also limit plate thickness. meet stiff challenge cost, weight volume issue bipolar/end plates, research focused finding metal low weight, cost easily machined thin plates. Metallic component higher conductivity, better mechanical property thus easily machined le cost, smaller volume relative graphite.2. Experimental2.1. Bipolar/end plate material designSeveral material investigated, could possible alternative commercial graphite bipolar/end plate material. Concentrating different factor like cost, density, mechanical strength availability, SS 316 (Stainless Steel 316) chosen alternative. Table 1 show comparison property graphite SS 316 material bipolar/end plate [7]. indicates SS 316 superior property compared commercially used graphite. However, SS 316 show weak corrosion resistance unlike graphite avoided surface modification method [8], [9], ongoing research laboratory.Table 1.

Hence, method useful predicting complete creep behavior material generating creep curve. Keywords: creep deformation; regression analysis; Kachanov–Rabotnov model; damage evolution; creep rupture 1. IntroductionIn materials, creep deformation divided three stages: primary, secondary, tertiary [1]. low temperature modest stresses, primary creep regime dominates. Primary creep strain accumulates high-temperature alloys, generally undetectable studies. low-to-intermediate stress temperature, secondary creep regime dominates [2]. stable domain, balance strain-hardening recovery mechanic make creep deformation prediction simple. tertiary creep regime dominates intermediate high temperature stresses. non-linear accumulation creep-damage ruptures, contributes massive creep deformation, characterizes regime.Since advent continuum damage mechanic (CDM) 1967–68, major effort gone applying CDM assessment creep damage high-temperature components, described Chaboche [3]. According Murakami [4], CDM approach utilized solve high-temperature engineering challenge aerospace, nuclear, power-generating industries. Engineers utilize CDM-based creep constitutive model anticipate material’s constitutive reaction also material’s subsequent rupture damage evolution. Betten [5] researched, CDM system previously used model elastic–brittle, elastic–plastic, fatigue, creep, creep–fatigue, iso-thermal iso-thermomechanical, anisotropic, corrosion, irradiation-induced damage. CDM effective stress concept used characterize damage process material crack initiation ruptures. continuous damage variable connected constitutive model’s viscosity function CDM technique incorporate impact microstructural damage constitutive response. documented Kachanov [6], damage variable expected grow zero (no damage) unity (rupture).According Skrzypek [7], within CDM, smallest volume statistically representative mean constitutive response including representative number micro-heterogeneities called representative volume element (RVE). effective stress concept allows transformation physical space heterogeneously damaged RVE effective space homogeneous undamaged RVE including damage effective stress increase. Damage irreversible representation heterogeneous micro-processes occur deformation material, distribution evolution influenced strain history, boundary conditions, time, environment. physical damage difficult quantify, Gordon Stewart [8] examined found may defined reduction area due internal surface defects. effective stress notion may analytically inferred using concept obtain net/effective stress, shown Equation (1): 𝜎=𝜎×𝐴0𝐴𝑛𝑒𝑡=𝜎(1−𝐴0−𝐴𝑛𝑒𝑡𝐴0)=𝜎(1−𝜔)σ¯=σ×A0Anet=σ1−A0−AnetA0=σ1−ω (1) 𝐴𝑛𝑒𝑡Anet current area, 𝐴0A0 initial area, 𝜎σ¯ equivalent stress, σ net/effective stress, ω represents damage reduction area. Physical damage replaced increase applied stress, effective [9]. equating finite element method RVE using effective stress concept, CDM theory implemented FEM codes.Several material model developed since 1929 provide prediction creep behavior materials. model developed certain boundary conditions, and, that, model may posse limitations, explained Yao et al. [10]. Three established model discussed article, method devised predict material’s creep response behavior tertiary stage damage evolution parameter [11]. Starting Norton–Bailey (NB) model, also known Norton’s power law, integrated finite element Abaqus software widely used creep analysis combination model developed Bailey Norton [12]. NB model work benchmark development models. creep deformation behavior material displaying time-dependent, inelastic deformation predicted using model. useful predicting material’s creep behavior secondary creep regime. hand, Omega model developed Material Properties Council offer good prediction model; widely used due simplicity lower dependency material constants. Prager [13] proposed model 1995, well-documented creep evaluation process excellent track record associated property relation covering wide range materials. Omega model method calculating remaining life component working creep zone high temperature pressures. According Yeom et al. [14], strain rate parameter multi-axial damage parameter used forecast rate strain accumulation, creep damage accumulation, remaining time failure function stress state temperature. model primary secondary creep regime deformation good predicting material’s rupture time lower temperature [15]. important model Kachanov–Rabotnov model, one earliest implementation continuum damage mechanic (CDM) approach creep, proposed Kachanov Rabotnov [6]. Secondary tertiary creep deformation modelled using set coupled equations. Significant effort made improve KR law, variation KR law developed recent year generate contour deformation map [8]. define transversely isotropic creep damage property estimate stress-independent tertiary creep damage constant using strain- damage-based analytical approaches, method devised Stewart Gordon [16]. Another significant creep prediction model theta projection, employed creep conditions. Evans Wilshire [17] presented theta projection model 1985 predict multistage creep deformation (primary, secondary, tertiary). modified form theta projection model, specific steel sheets, investigated applied Alipour Nejad [18] ferritic steel alloys. hyperbolic model, developed Stewart 2013 [19], latest development creep prediction models, effectively utilized Alipour Nejad [20] ferritic steel elevated temperatures. three-stage creep damage model ability simulate primary, secondary, tertiary creep better accuracy.Several researcher found creep prediction model proved accurate specific material certain stress level temperature conditions, neither single model precisely predict creep behavior variation material alloy model meet expectation service condition investigated Benallal [21]. example, Norton–Bailey model model secondary creep regime prediction regimes. produced overall error primary tertiary creep dominant. Batsoulas [22] highlighted limitation Norton–Bailey creep model arguing use relation design indicated (i) creep curve straight line, (ii) primary tertiary creep neglected, (iii) rate secondary creep defined exclusive designing parameter, definitely case. According May Furtado [23], material constant Norton–Bailey equation heavily dependent upon temperature, and, that, model unable produce accurate result higher temperatures.The fracture strain MPC Omega model difficult estimate equipment service condition due limited temperature-dependent material data elevated temperatures. pointed Maruyama et al. [24], model also lack method indicating prior ongoing damage material fracture begin likely expand. model also unable predict accurate creep result high-temperature high-stress applications, highlight major drawback. case creep life prediction dissimilar P91/12Cr1MoV-steel-welded joints, investigated Chen et al. [25], accuracy predicted rupture time became much closer actual value lower stress level. error 12.7% stress 160 MPa, increased 75.4% stress 220 MPa temperature condition 550 °C.The model proposed Kachanov–Rabotnov (KR) promising, involves large number material constants, formulation consider primary creep regime analysis. KR emulates continuum creep damage discontinuous plastic damage rupture within continuous function, model complexity proven difficult integration FE analysis [26]. difficulty finding tertiary creep damage constant another key drawback KR model. Haque Stewart [27] conducted comparative analytical case study sine-hyperbolic (sin-h) Kachanov–Rabotnov (KR) creep damage model forecasting minimum creep strain rate, creep deformation, damage progression, rupture 304 stainless steel 600 °C 700 °C. KR rupture prediction linear log–log scale, cannot adequately explain sigmoidal behavior seen experimental data. KR-model re-calibrated meet either high- low-stress environments, cannot model time. yield strength, sin-h rupture prediction approach value le unity close nominal ultimate tensile strength 304SS. rupture time approached zero, KR rupture prediction approached accuracy value 1.35 time greater ultimate tensile strength [27]. Haque Stewart [28] Stewart Gordon [29] eventually identified faulty character KR model named “brittle curve” phenomenon. KR model adjusted handle high stress low stress bend adding extra factor material constant keeping flaw critical damage le unity. brief, model dealt issue nucleation plasticity crack initiation growth success level, limitation accurately detecting identifying creep crack growth still apparent [30].Little attention paid designing optimization sensitivity analysis involving design parameter creep prediction, especially tertiary creep stage [31]. article, curve-fitting technique proposed applying Kachanov–Rabotnov model embedded Norton–Bailey FEA model. creep parameter involving damage evolution parameter regressed represent material’s behavior tertiary creep stage. extrapolation creep behavior performed fitting different form creep models, Kachanov–Rabotnov case, small number creep data set simulating beyond available data points, explained Brown et al. [32]. Comparative assessment proposed Kachanov–Rabotnov model curve fitting-technique preformed creep damage models, Omega Norton–Bailey, highlight significances.The purpose study identify tertiary creep damage constants, difficult determine material high temperatures. research significance provides method determine tertiary stage constant analyze material’s behavior tertiary creep stage. extrapolation based assumption existing trend available data set continue model’s functional form appropriately capture creep behavior extrapolated region. Extrapolations generally unreliable difficult ass [33]. 0% 100% dependability band creep–rupture expand applied stress lowered, point band may differ decade apart low stress level elevated temperature [34]. uncertainty extrapolation paired material performance necessitates use generous safety factor design. guarantee reliability new material 30,000 h creep data extrapolated 100,000 h [28].In case study, FEA creep assessment performed material SS-316 dog bone specimen, considered material coupon predict time-dependent plastic deformation along creep behavior elevated temperature 650 °C constant stress [35]. data-optimization sensitivity study conducted applying response surface methodology along ANOVA technique track material’s creep behavior three creep damage model [36]. result indicated specimen underwent steady secondary creep deformation analysis period. Hence, method useful predicting complete creep behavior material generating complete creep curve covering primary, secondary, tertiary creep stages. uncertainty material’s behavior tertiary stage near rupture predicted accurately [37]. 2. Theoretical FrameworkThis section describes theoretical framework creep material models, mathematical formulation, combined implementation prediction material’s creep behavior, SS-316 case. 2.1. Norton Bailey ModelThe famous common minimum creep strain rate law Norton’s power law (1929), based Arrhenius rate equation [38] depicted Equation (2). 𝜀˙𝑐𝑟=𝐵′𝜎𝑛𝑒𝑥𝑝(−𝑄𝑐𝑅𝑇/)𝑡𝑚ε˙cr=B′σnexp−QcRTtm (2) 𝜀˙𝑐𝑟ε˙cr represents minimal creep strain rate, B′ represents material constant, σ applied stress, n represents power law exponent, 𝑄𝑐Qc represents activation energy, R universal gas constant, represents applied temperature. Equation (2) simplified constant temperature, taking form Equation (3). 𝜀˙𝑐𝑟=𝐴 𝜎𝑛𝑡𝑚ε˙cr=A σntm (3) without considering time, Equation (3) becomes: 𝜀˙𝑐𝑟=𝐴𝜎𝑛ε˙cr=Aσn (4) where, 𝐴=𝐵′𝑒𝑥𝑝(−𝑄𝑐𝑅𝑇/)A=B′exp−QcRT (5) worth noting A, n, temperature-dependent material constant affected stress. n unitless, unit consistent time stress σ. time-differentiated version Equation (3) often referred time-hardening formulation power-law creep [39]. 2.2. Omega ModelIn Omega model, life fraction used (or damage parameter, ω) defined Equation (6): 𝜔=𝑡𝑡𝑟=𝜀˙𝛺𝑡1+𝜀˙ 𝛺𝑡ω=ttr=ε˙Ωt1+ε˙ Ωt (6) current time, tr rupture life, 𝜀˙ε˙ current creep strain rate, Ω material creep damage constant. current time approach rupture, (t ▶ tr & t/tr ▶ 1) Equation (6) collapses. Thus, life fraction evolves zero near unity (0 ≤ t/tr < 1). Prager [15] proposed creep strain following relation Equation (7): 1−𝜀˙0𝛺𝑡=1𝑒𝜀˙𝛺/1−ε˙0Ωt=1eε˙Ω (7) 𝜀˙ε˙ creep strain, 𝜀˙0ε˙0 initial creep strain rate constant, Ωt damage constant respect time. Taking natural logarithm side rearranging give Equation (8): 𝜀𝐶0˙=−1𝛺 ln(1−𝜀˙0𝛺𝑡),εC0˙=−1Ω ln1−ε˙0Ωt, (8) Equation (8) simplified taking derivative respect time replacing (1 − 𝜀˙0ε˙0 Ωt) follows: 𝜀𝑐˙=𝜀˙𝑐0 𝑒𝜀𝑐𝛺εc˙=ε˙c0 eεcΩ (9) Omega model, shown Equation (9), assumes creep strain rate proportional exponent accumulated creep strain ignores primary creep stage.

Moreover, stress corrosion cracking (SCC) issue frequently reported fluorine chemistry industry [2], [7], [8]. Thus, SCC behavior 316 L SS HF vapor environment need considered.The occurrence stress corrosion associated many factors, including microstructure, type corrosive ions, loading condition [9]. Generally, SCC occurred materials/environments certain range corrosion rate [10]. Especially cracking affected hydrogen embrittlement, higher corrosion rate may make hydrogen ineffective stress corrosion, resulting low hydrogen-induced stress corrosion susceptibility. general corrosion, 316 L SS showed corrosion rate 32.53 mm/y 40 wt% HF solution (>10−6 mm/s), higher HF vapor environment [11], [12]. corrosion behavior 316 L SS HF vapor environment similar atmospheric corrosion. Whether stress corrosion behavior 316 L SS HF vapor significant need investigated. initiation region stress corrosion crack mainly located locally defective area area inferior mechanical properties, consequence corrosive ion erosion. favorable condition established, stress corrosion crack initiate propagate synergetic effect chemistry mechanics. Thus, interaction HF vapor matrix tensile stress prerequisite nucleation stress corrosion crack 316 L SS.To date, understanding SCC mechanism metallic material corrosive medium divided two viewpoints. One active dissolution (AD)-dominated process (e.g., film rupture process, local corrosion-induced cracking mechanism selective dissolution (oxidation) mechanism, etc.) [13], [14], another hydrogen embrittlement (HE) induced detrimental effect hydrogen (e.g., hydrogen-enhanced localized plasticity (HELP), hydrogen-enhanced decohesion (HEDE), hydrogen adsorption-induced dislocation emission (AIDE), etc.) [15], [16]. AD mechanism reported HF environment [2], [17], [18]. equipment-stored AHF, hydrogen blister main reason stress corrosion failure, due hydrogen dissociation AHF penetration matrix [19], [20], [21], [22]. Moreover, cold-worked austenitic SSs (e.g., 301 SS, 302 SS, 304 SS), martensite induced strain hardening absorption site H atoms, resulted elongation loss [2], [22], [23]. generally recognized metallic material body centered cubic (BCC) structure prone suffer failure HF environment [2]. AD mechanism, found pit formed Q345R steel 316 L SS HF solution origin stress corrosion pre-corrosion fatigue [12], [17]. preferential intergranular penetration HF vapor Monel 400 enhanced SCC susceptibility [18], [24], [25], [26], [27]. underlying coupling action mechanic chemistry considered weakening mechanical property intergranular region internal penetration HF vapor [28]. However, main controlling mechanism stress corrosion failure 316 L SS HF vapor remains unknown.In corrosion systems, numerous corrosion model proposed based interaction mechanic chemistry, including slip-dissolution/passivation model [29], film rupture model [30], [31], selective preferential oxidation/dissolution model [32], [33], etc. Badwe et al. [34] analyzed effect interaction mechanic chemistry intergranular SCC failure binary alloy (Ag–Au alloys), finding demonstrated nano-porous morphology located grain boundary induced cracking. Therefore, formation dealloying region considered important prerequisite crack incubation, stated role stress dealloying corrosion could decoupled. However, research high-temperature oxidative SCC, local deformation region (grain boundaries) attracted oxygen injection, selectively oxidized base metal (Cr elements) [35], [36]. formation oxidation product accompanied generation vacancies, attracted dislocation aggregation, deteriorated stress/strain concentration grain boundaries, promoted initiation intergranular crack [37], [38], [39], [40]. process, stress oxidation interacted other, showing coupling effect, essence internal oxidation theory [33], [41]. way, different understanding SCC mechanism mechanical chemical interaction different environments.The object study aim investigate SCC failure behavior 316 L SS HF vapor. First, slow strain rate test (SSRT) conducted detect whether 316 L SS susceptible SCC HF vapor. Hydrogen charging test carried elucidate effect hydrogen 316 L SS stress corrosion HF vapor. Moreover, fractographies tensile testing HF vapor hydrogen environment examined scanning electron microscopy (SEM), reason formation brittle feature analyzed. Then, C-ring sample used intermittently observe record SCC process 316 L SS HF vapor SEM equipped X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), aimed reveal relationship corrosion initial cracking 316 L SS HF vapor environment.

Discussion4.1. formation mechanism quasi-cleavage brittle facetThe SCC 316 L SS HF vapor mainly manifested formation large region brittle quasi-cleavage facets. general, quasi-cleavage facet often appear material fractured [15], [44]. Whether quasi-cleavage facet induced hydrogen embrittlement need analyzed. Firstly, order confirm effect hydrogen, stress corrosion test 316 L SS pre-charging H in-situ charge H carried out, result shown Fig. 12. found mechanical property 316 L SS pre-charge H RT 50 °C reduce significantly, SCC susceptibility lower 10% (Fig. 12 (a) (b)). fracture mode still dominated ductile fracture necking characteristics, slight brittle region observed (Fig. 12 (c1), (d1), (c2) (d2)). contrast, in-situ H charging significant effect 316 L SS, manifested reduced tensile strength elongation, hydrogen embrittlement sensitivity 50% 50 °C. However, still lower stress corrosion sensitivity (77.0%) sample HF vapor condition (Fig. 4(d)). Secondly, although large area brittle region detected fracture surface in-situ H charging specimen, brittle region relatively smooth like cleavage facet (Fig. 12 (e2) (f2)), similar characteristic literature [45]. While, fracture surface SCC specimen HF vapor show typical quasi-cleavage facet, numerous fragment particle product form (Fig. 9(e) (f)), different fracture feature hydrogen environment. Thirdly, material damaged hydrogen infiltration, characteristic length hydrogen diffusion depends diffusion coefficient hydrogen 316 L SS. Fig. 13 (a) (b), crack length 316 L SS SSRT HF vapor RT range 22 72 µm, becomes 76–146 µm 50 °C maximum crack length 528 µm. average crack growth rate obtained based crack length test time Fig. 13 (c), maximum average crack growth rate 316 L SSRT HF vapor RT 50 °C 8.54 × 10−10 m/s 5.70 × 10−9 m/s, respectively. characteristic diffusion length hydrogen, L=2Dt, diffusion coefficient hydrogen 316 L SS approximately 10−17 m2/s 273 K 10−15 m2/s 323 K [46], [47]. Thus, average diffusion rate hydrogen generated cathodic reaction reach 1.36 × 10−11 m/s 273 K 1.95 × 10−10 m/s 323 K, far lower maximum crack growth rate 316 L SS HF vapor. Moreover, corrosion rate 316 L SS stress corrosion HF vapor RT 50 °C 27 mm/y (8.86 ×10−10 m/s) 66 mm/y (2.11 ×10−9 m/s) (Fig. 5), respectively, almost consistent crack growth rate. mean even though hydrogen formed SCC process permeates specimens, hydrogen play leading role cracking process, due fact 316 L SS show higher degradation rate HF vapor hydrogen diffusion rate. Therefore, based analysis, concluded hydrogen play negligible role crack initiation propagation 316 L SS HF vapor reason formation quasi-cleavage facet.Download : Download high-res image (548KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 12.

Numerous crack initiate slip line propagate along slip plane. Especially plane cross slip occurs, interaction slip line tends nucleate microcracks intersection points, micro-cracks grow large crack connecting different slip planes, result formation valley-like ridge-like crack planes. Fig. 14 (b)-(d) show EBSD result surface containing cracks. stress corrosion crack induced HF vapor mainly transgranular (TG) cracks, whose direction highly consistent planar slip system {111}< 110 > (Fig. 14 (b)). activation dislocation sliding lead stress corrosion cracks.

Fig. 14 (d) show distribution Schmid factor {111}< 110 > slip system crack region. Schmid factor high (>0.36) location stress corrosion crack occur, meaning region inclined slide along {111} planes. corrosion product growing surface show porous structures, prone fracture due local deformation slip (Fig. 9 Fig. 10). cracking area expose bottom matrix, facilitates attack corrosive medium, making degradation slip area far serious areas. Thus, considered formation quasi-cleavage facet symbol TG fracture, consequence slip-induced corrosion product cracking.Download : Download high-res image (1MB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 14.

Effect chemical degradation SCCDuring initial corrosion stage, HF vapor promote formation brittle granular product also injected matrix (Fig. 10 (a)). found preferential corrosion Fe Cr element lead formation dealloying region, important factor occurrence SCC 316 L SS HF vapor environment. several reason Fe Cr preferentially corroded. Firstly, Cr Fe element likely lose electron form cation Ni element due higher reducibility [49], [50], [51]. Fe2+, Fe3+ Cr3+ cation preferentially combine anion solution form compounds. Secondly, main component corrosion product FeF2, FeF3, CrF3 small amount NiF2 (Fig. 8). standard Gibbs free energy formation FeF2, FeF3, CrF3 NiF2 − 25.916 kJ/mol, − 22.175 kJ/mol, − 61.596 kJ/mol − 13.117 kJ/mol, respectively (calculated HSC 6.0). negative standard Gibbs free energy formation Fe Cr fluoride NiF2 suggest affinity (Fe, Cr) element fluoride ion stronger formation compound easier. Thirdly, Yang et al. calculated Pourbaix diagram Fe, Cr Ni element HF solution, NiF2 Ni metal found range ESHE pH containing FeF2, FeF3 CrF3 compound [52]. indicates Ni still exists stable metal state, activity corrosion reaction high compared Fe Cr elements. believed important reason nickel-based alloy better performance HF environment stainless steels. reason Fe Cr element prone corrosion HF vapor, resulting occurrence dealloying. Thus, Fe Cr preferentially diffuse outwards matrix react HF vapor generate metallic fluoride oxide (Table 2), resulting loss Fe Cr element matrix close product. shown Fig. 8, Fig. 11 (d) (e), Mo detected corrosion product region adjacent crack tips, suggests Mo element actively participates corrosion process. Mo element always considered beneficial element could actively participate passivation process material HF environment stabilize structure passive film, resulting excellent performance passive film [53], [54], [55]. mainly related high reaction activity Mo element. reducibility Mo element higher Cr, Fe Ni element [49], mean Mo element easier lose electron HF vapor [56]. oxidized Mo cation quickly combine anion medium (i.e. F-) form corresponding compound accumulate sample. Therefore, MoF3 MoF4 detected indicated XRD analysis (Fig. 8). Similar phenomenon could also found others research [55], [56]. Therefore, due special characteristic Mo element, Mo could always detected passive film corrosion HF environment [53], [56], [57].The combined effect preferential diffusion metallic element rapid invasion corrosive ion lead formation dealloying region near surface. understand chemical degradation affect cracking, nano-indentation test carried result shown Fig. 15. hardness matrix interface (dealloying region) 4.27 GPa 0.66 GPa. Dohr et al. [58] used focused ion beam (FIB) technology prepare microcantilevers compare mechanical property matrix oxidized grain boundary alloy 600, result showed premature failure occurred oxidized grain boundary (dealloying region), brittle fracture minimal plastic deformation. dealloying region subjected 5 mN loading, contrast matrix, dealloying region rupture (Fig. 15 (a)), indicating premature failure occurs. Due lower hardness dealloying region compared matrix, indenter pressed in, dealloying region break quickly relative lower load. Since load indenter reached set load, indenter continues move stop pressing reaching set load. Therefore, load-displacement curve obtained dealloying region show lower load higher displacement compared matrix (Fig. 15 (b)). Research dealloying zone frequency reported stainless steel tested simulated PWR primary water [39], [40], [59], well binary alloy copper corrosion Mattsson's solution [60], [61]. formed dealloying region depended elemental type, content environment [10], [62], [63]. study, formation dealloying region depends high reaction activity Fe Cr element 316 L HF vapor.

Afterwards, corrosive ion injected dealloying region internal defect surface corrosion product dealloying region (such voids), reducing mechanical property (Fig. 15). dealloying region also prone cracking, large number stress corrosion crack initiate sample surface initial stage (Fig. 16). main coordinated deformation mode 316 L SS, planar slip provides tearing force crack nucleation SCC HF vapor environment, also accelerates corrosion, mainly planar slip form new surface attract erosion. one hand, H. Masuda [66] found Volta potential slip step 304 SS negative stress corrosion MgCl2 environment, exhibited high corrosion susceptibility facilitated crack initiation. hand, due uniform corrosion characteristic HF vapor, sample’s surface covered layer film initial corrosion stage, integrity film destroyed plane slip. Compared area covered film, exposed fresh matrix slip step show higher activity, accelerating anodic dissolution process. Similarly, R.C. Newman [67] found passive film damaged slip resulted higher anodic current density increased active dissolution exposed matrix, beneficial stress corrosion crack initiation. corrosion process, corrosion product uniformly deposit surface many crevice observed (Fig. 6 (b1, c1) Fig. 7 (a1, b1)). void crevice corrosion product became preferential channel medium diffusion ion migration [41]. corrosion product torn, medium rapidly intrude matrix via fractured channel (crevices). HF environment, Dai et al. [17] found exposed matrix formed corrosion galvanic cell area corrosion product accumulated, exposed matrix area rapidly dissolved anode, leading formation local corrosion. Therefore, high reactivity matrix crevice due rapid intrusion HF vapor, area corrosion product closely packed, intrusion diffusion rate HF vapor reduced, matrix crevice spontaneously form corrosion galvanic cell surrounding area. Driven galvanic cell, degradation process matrix bottom crevice anode accelerated, resulting continuous formation dealloying region ahead crack tip, promotes crack growth. Consequently, deeper stress corrosion crack always detected bottom crevice corrosion product rupture (Fig. 7 (a2) (b2)).Download : Download high-res image (553KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 16.

IntroductionUnderstanding reactor internals degradation resulting long-term exposure high level displacing radiation damage vital aging management existing commercial reactor important consideration advanced reactor system developed operate higher temperature and/or aggressive chemical environment current reactor systems. One area major concern radiation influence deformation failure behavior in-core materials. Studies dating back several decade shown highly irradiated metal susceptible plastic instability relatively low level post-irradiation strain leading premature onset necking failure [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. type behavior related heterogeneous microstructural deformation process caused interaction microstructural element introduced deformation existing radiation-induced microstructure.The link radiation induced change microstructure plastic deformation failure behavior austenitic stainless steel yet completely understood. Microstructural deformation behavior observed strongly influenced factor alloy composition, irradiation temperature, dose, testing temperature strain-rate [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. order qualify alloy potential application advanced reactor systems, critical understand deformation failure behavior range expected operating conditions.Several recent study shown lower irradiation testing temperatures, deformation irradiated stainless steel proceeds formation extremely fine twin and/or generation defect free dislocation channel along {1 1 1} type slip planes. deformation characterized highly planar motion dislocation [6], [7], [8], [9]. study focused lower dose temperature irradiation primary microstructural constituent small black spot-damage, small faulted loop cases, small bubbles. still unclear irradiation testing parameter influence deformation behavior highly irradiated austenitic stainless steel containing population voids, large faulted dislocation loop precipitates.Following shutdown EBR-II, variety stainless steel internal structural component well characterized temperature, flux fluence history became available study. material resided region outside fueled region core reflector blanket region thus experienced irradiation condition different previously studied reactor operation. current study, effect radiation-induced microstructure (as function dose irradiation temperature) strain-rate post-irradiation deformation behavior 12% cold-worked 316 SS evaluated.2.

DiscussionA variety study conducted microstructural deformation behavior austenitic stainless irradiated lower temperature (<300 °C) tested range temperature [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. microstructures produced lower temperature irradiation substantially different observed current study comparison studies, serve indicate controlling mechanism changing deformation behavior. lower temperature irradiation tend produce high density fine (<10 nm) defect black spot damage, small faulted loop small helium bubbles. Substantial second phase precipitation typically observed lower temperatures. comparison, microstructures produced sample irradiated EBR-II approximately 380 445 °C composed large (>20 nm) faulted loops, void significant second phase precipitation.Examples behavior occurs lower irradiation test temperature include change deformation mode increasing test temperature decreasing strain-rate observed sample heavy-ion irradiated 304 SS tested room temperature 288 °C [6], [7]. sample irradiated 500 °C, temperature shift due increased displacement rate heavy-ions, microstructures formed similar formed 300 °C neutron irradiations. Microstructural deformation behavior transitioned dislocation glide deformation twinning increasing dose room temperature, 288 °C twinning dislocation channeling observed strain-rate 2.0 × 10−4 s−1. strain-rate decreasing 2.5 × 10−6 s−1, deformation mode switched completely dislocation channeling. result contrast current study, suggests strong influence strain-rate microstructural deformation behavior irradiation testing condition examined.In 316 LN sample irradiated 200 °C ions, deformed disc bend fixture approximately 10% strain [8], [9], high density extended fault generated deformation becoming planar increasing dose. Extended fault observed cluster band forming twins, conjectured passage leading dislocation extended stacking fault result unfaulting clearing defect forming reduced defect channels. impact radiation-induced defect restrict cross-slip induce highly planar deformation behavior. mechanism present current samples, twin observed microstructure would contain reduced population defects. Observations indicated case seems neither twin channel formation present.One interesting study showed twenty percent CW 316 SS sample irradiated high dose (13–17 × 1022 n/cm2(E > 0.1 MeV)) tensile tested range temperature revealed formation high density fine martensite platelet [12]. conjectured large amount swelling alloy led depletion Ni surrounding matrix causing material become unstable formation martensite. fracture surface lower temperature perpendicular tensile axis, indicating brittle cleavage failure, higher temperature failure characterized flow localization, process termed channel fracture. TEM image revealed region extreme localization contained void elongated direction shear. Although alloy earlier study similar irradiated study, sample irradiated higher doses, consequently amount swelling also greater. Comparison earlier study present result would suggest critical dose, related primarily extent swelling, radiation-induced matrix compositional change lead change deformation behavior.The TEM result consistent observed tensile behavior. addition three sample examined study additional six sample tested compare strain-rate effect [13]. statistically measurable difference UTS UE sample function strain-rate. major difference sample tested lower strain-rate exhibited dynamic strain aging behavior manifest serration stress-strain curve. behavior also commonly seen unirradiated sample tested slow strain-rates caused pinning dislocation solute atom [14]. stress level high enough, dislocation break free solute environment, causing load drop. dislocation come rest, solute atom diffusion pin again, leading load oscillation increasing strain.In combination, current earlier work suggest relatively complex relationship alloy deformation behavior irradiation testing conditions. Irradiation condition produce high density small (10 nm less) obstacle tend enhance transition localized planar deformation lower testing temperatures, decreasing strain-rate. contrary, behavior observed sample irradiated tested elevated temperature investigated present study. One possible explanation change behavior temperature combination larger faulted dislocation loop increasing stacking fault energy temperature. Larger loop le stable likely unfault particularly elevated temperatures. Additionally, stacking fault energy increase temperature [14], restriction cross-slip eased highly planar deformation behavior lead dislocation channeling early onset plastic instability absent. mentioned previously, stated conclusively localization deformation occur higher level strain. order evaluate this, necked region tensile gauge would analyzed.5. ConclusionsThe transition highly localized deformation behavior early onset plastic instability observed study conducted lower irradiation testing temperature present 12% CW 316 SS irradiated temperature dose range 380–440 °C 9–42 dpa, respectively tested 430 °C. Deformation behavior observably changed function strain-rate, appeared proceed unfaulting dislocation loop relatively uniform gliding dislocations. behavior explained relatively unstable nature faulted dislocation loop temperatures, enhanced ability dislocation cross-slip.AcknowledgementsThe author wish thank D.

IntroductionAbility produce part dimensional accuracy good surface finish high material removal rate high tool life primary requirement good cutting tool [1]. Difficult machine material like hardened steel stainless steel pose major challenge respect criterion mentioned manufacturing industry compromise one achieve others, viz. good accuracy finish low material removal rate [2]. Improving tool life higher material removal rate improved accuracy finish thus need hour. order achieve several new cutting tool excellent property cemented carbide, cermets, ceramic ultra-hard material (CBN, PCBN PCD) developed time [3]. However, cost cutting tool compared conventionally existing HSS tool steel much higher. time, several strategy like coating, alloying heat treatment used improve tool life HSS steels. mentioned strategies, heat treatment tool steel cheapest convenient methodologies. Moreover, heat treatment known modify entire bulk material compared coating protect surface [3]. particular, cryogenic heat treatment tool steel one well-known effective method improving dimensional stability fatigue behavior, grindability, hardness, toughness wear resistance [4–7].Cryogenic treatment known reduce residual stress also improves fatigue life wear resistance tool steel considered supplementary conventional heat treatment technique [7–11]. Cryogenic treatment increase hardness toughness simultaneously increase life HSS tool 100% [7, 12, 13]. improvement property attributed transformation retained austenite softer phase harder martensitic phase production stable structure. Meng et al [14] reported 6.5% retained austenite conventional heat treated sample compared 5.1% shallow cryogenic treatment (SCT) 2.7% deep cryogenic treatment (DCT) samples. resulted increase wear resistance HSS tool [15, 16]. Another mechanism proposed increase tool life precipitation fine carbide distributed matrix tool steel subjected long duration cryogenic treatment [17].Cryogenic treatment either shallow cryogenic treatment (SCT) material taken room temperature temperature ranging −50 °C −100 °C deep cryogenic treatment (DCT) temperature −125 °C [18, 19]. treatment reduces completely eliminates retained austenite apart formation secondary carbide particle better dispersed matrix [20, 21]. Mohan Lal et al [22] reported 100% improvement tool life. Das et al [23] analyzed change wear resistance cryo-treated tool steel varying soaking time 132 h concluded soaking time 36 h result optimum result cold work tool steel. Çiçek et al [24] able achieve 200% increase tool life due DCT drilling austenitic steel using HSS drills. finding attributed formation finer carbide precipitates. reported cryo-treatment result property even superior TiN coatings.Although precipitation fine carbide transformation retained austenite martensite attributed main reason improvement tool life, proper understanding metallurgical phenomenon take place exist due cryogenic treatment [25, 26]. Moreover, wide range (100 800%) improvement tool life reported varied cryogenic treatment time [27]. still lack common agreement respect mechanism behind improved tool performance methodology followed. necessitates investigation widespread adoption treatment technique manufacturing industries.The methodology followed study shown figure 1. primary objective work analyze effect different holding time cryo-treatment M2 HSS tool drilling AISI 316SS. effect gradual cooling −120 °C −184 °C optimum holding time cutting force (thrust), surface finish, chip morphology drill flank wear also studied.Zoom Zoom Reset image size Figure 1.

Hardness variationThe post-cryogenic treatment given specimen showed remarkable impact intermittent hardness soaking time increased. steep rise hardness particularly observed till 12 h cryo-soaking rate increase becomes gradual 24 h, hardness highest. variation hardness difference holding time explained cleary literature far. variation report mainly due difference selected parameter hardening tempering treatment tool steels. However, well known nucleation secondary carbide (SCs), mainly tertiary eta-carbides dissolution primary carbide (PCs) major reason increase hardness tool steel [14]. Also, transformation retained austenite martensitic phase major contributor increase hardness. mechanism governed temperature time holding. liquid nitrogen temperature usually sufficient complete transformation retained austenite martensite thereby resulting increase hardness. factor governs increase hardness holding time. report suggested far show increase hardness increase holding time. However, report used holding time le 36 h [31, 32]. one report far holding time 136 h. observed hardness decrease holding time greater 36 h [23]. result consistent result obtained study. could direct result Ostwald ripening mechanism [33] result increasing precipitate size increasing soaking times. increase SC precipitate size show figure 11(b) fact observed sample longer holding times. variation hardness various cryo-treated drill shown figure 8.Zoom Zoom Reset image size Figure 8.

Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui pengaruh tekana tempa dan waktu pengelasan terhadap sifat fisik dan mekanik sambungan logam tak sejenis antara baja tahan karat SS 316 dan AISI 4140. Variasi tekanan tempa yang digunakan 110 kg/cm2, 130 kg/cm2 dan 150 kg/cm2, sedangkan variasi waktu pengelasan yang digunakan adalah 35 detik, 50 detik dan 65 detik. Hasil dari penelitian menunjukkan bahwa meningkatnya variasi tekanan tempa dan waktu pengelasan mengakibatkan berkurangnya panjang spesimen, dikarenakan terjadi prose pelumeran pada daerah sambungan pengelasan pada kedua material. Sedangkan semakin berkurangnya panjang spesimen disisi lain mengakibatkan melebarnya panjang flash yang dihasilkan. Hasil struktur mikro terlihat terjadi pengkasaran butir (grain coarsened) terjadi pada daerah HAZ bentuk dan ukuran butiran berbeda jika dibandingkan dengan logam induk. Nilai kekerasann daerah sambungan rerata sebesar 246,4 HVN. Nilai kekerasan pada logam induk material AISI 4140 rerata sebesar 354,7 HVN. Sedangkan logam induk material SS 316 rerata sebesar 183,5 HVN. Nilai kekerasan antara kedua logam induk tersebut sangat berbeda jauh dikarenakan fasa pada baja AISI 4140 lebih dominan fasa perlit yang memiliki kekerasan tinggi. Nilai kekuatan tarik yang optimal dihasilkan pada variasi tekanan tempa130 kg/cm2 variasi waktu gesek 35 detik dengan nilai sebesar 455.02 N/mm2. Referensi W. Harsono O. T.

Korosi merupakan permasalahan umum yang sering terjadi pada logam dan paduannya. Metode pengujian secara elektrokimia merupakan salah satu metode yang tepat untuk mempelajari korosi logam dan paduannya dalam lingkungan tertentu. Pada penelitian ini dilakukan evaluasi baja tahan karat SS 316 dalam medium air demin dan nano fluida yang mengandung partikel nano ZrO2 dengan metode elektrokimia. Potensial korosi, polarisasi Tafel, dan Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) digunakan untuk mempelajari perilaku elektrokimia baja tahan karat SS 316 dalam medium air demin dan nano fluida dengan variasi waktu perendaman selama 10, 60 dan 120 menit. Hasil pengukuran terhadap potensial korosi baja tahan karat SS 316 dalam medium air demin dan nanofluid menunjukkan peningkatan seiring dengan bertambahnya waktu perendaman. Hasil pengukuran konstanta Tafel anodik pada baja tahan karat SS 316 dalam medium air demin dan nano fluida menunjukkan bahwa nilai konstanta Tafel naik dengan dengan bertambahnya waktu perendaman. Hasil analisis polarisasi Tafel ditunjukkan bahwa laju korosi baja tahan karat SS 316 dalam medium air demin dan nanofluid tidak terlihat perbedaan yang berarti dan laju korosi cenderung turun seiring dengan bertambahnya waktu perendaman. Hasil analsis dengan EIS pada baja tahan karat SS 316 menunjukkan bahwa nilai impedance yang tinggi dalam medium nano fluida sehingga memiliki laju korosi yang rendah bila dibandingkan dalam medium air demin. Analisis dengan difraksi sinar X (X-RD) menunjukkan bahwa fasa utama pada baja tahan karat SS 316 hasil pengujian korosi dalam medium air demin dan nano fluida adalah γ-austenit. Baja tahan karat SS 316 mempunyai ketahanan korosi yang tinggi dalam medium air demin dan nano fluida dengan laju korosi di bawah 1 MPY.Kata kunci: SS 316, korosi, ZrO2, nano fluida, metode EIS Teks Lengkap: PDF Refbacks Saat ini tidak ada refbacks.
