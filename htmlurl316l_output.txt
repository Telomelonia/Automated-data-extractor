Since embedding concept currently developing, research community focus survival, functionality, data quality embedded elements. However, another important aspect manufacturing process need interrupted sensor integration. study investigates influence process interruption static tensile properties. result reveal distinct impact process discontinuity tensile properties. yield strength Rp0.2 ultimate tensile strength Rm dropped 13% horizontally orientated tensile bar 18% vertical samples. True stress horizontal vertical sample also negatively affected process interruption. Furthermore, hybrid tensile bar consist half conventionally half additively manufactured part tested since manufacturing approach also implies start SLM process within final part’s shape. samples, true stress plastic strain value represent even mix vertical conventional tensile bars. samples, location failure analyzed fractographic cross-sectional analyses. SLM samples, process interruption represents potential weakening cross section, even though sample broke interruption zone. hybrid tensile bar fail transition zone, consequently weak spot samples.

IntroductionSelective laser melting (PBF-LB) laser-based additive manufacturing technology expanding industry fabricate new complex product well repair existing part damaged service operation [1]. PBF-LB continuous process melting depositing powder feedstock, layer layer, using laser heat source. PBF-LB becoming accepted eco-friendly features, term material utilization low waste, compared conventional manufacturing [2]. PBF-LB capability producing part 3D modeled. PBF-LB built customized deposit material similar dissimilar substrate [3]. Austenitic stainless steels, SS 316L, particular interest application challenging high corrosive environment [4], maintain excellent combination high strength ductility, even low temperature [5]. Considering engineering applications, SS 316L exhibit obvious intergranular corrosion resistance chemicals, salt acids, Molybdenum (Mo) provides better protection marine environment [6]. SS 316L steel combine outstanding strength, corrosion resistance, biocompatibility property [7,8] low-temperature fracture toughness. PBF-LB combined SS 316L fabrication parts, characteristic microstructure, composed fine equiaxed columnar grains, cellular substructure, produced different deposition cooling rate conditions. Bertoli et al. [9] observed cellular substructure variety SS 316L components, fabricated mean PBF-LB, using 60, 175, 380 W laser power 30, 750, 2500 mm/s scanning speed, largest cell size (839 ± 125) 60 W, 30 mm/s, smallest (478 ± 76) 380 W, 2500 mm/s PBF-LB settings. measured UTS three sample 633 ± 2 MPa lowest laser power settings, 619 ± 24 MPa medium ones, 529 ± 18 MPa highest power settings. another study, Birnbaum et al. [10] reported PBF-LB build SS 316L sample appearance typical substructure depended cooling rate advancement solid/liquid interface. literature, common method used test mechanical performance PBF-LB part tensile test, although chemical microstructure gradient along growth direction may introduce accidental non-uniform elastic plastic deformations. versatile method ass mechanical properties, also account eventual microstructural anisotropy, instrumented indentation test (IIT). material tested method form free-standing thin film multilayers, coatings, bulk solid [11,12,13]. method permit different scale microstructure material characterized using differently shaped indenters. ISO standard 14577-1 outline three different scale IIT:nano-scale: hmax ≤ 0.2 µmmicro-scale: Fmax < 2 N, hmax > 0.2 µmmacro-scale: 2 N ≤ F ≤ 30 kNThe test particularly useful record load depth instant time. IIT, indenter forced penetrate tested material defined peak load (Fmax) controlled (loading penetration) rate, held peak load specific time (tholding), finally, released controlled rate [14].Upon indentation, material deformed elasto-plastically, plasticity tends fully developed (Tabor’s requirement), necessary measure indentation hardness. Indentation property indentation hardness (Hit), indentation modulus (Eit) also extracted recorded load-depth data. Although nano-indentation (nIIT) sense mechanical response material near surface shallower subsurface, macro-indentation (MIIT) able sense material response across larger bulk volume. large, indented volume likely contains essential feature microstructure resemble involved tensile compression test. Thus, macro-indentation may provide equivalent testing method ass elastoplastic response material quick manner. Nanoscale artefacts, surface asperity [15], indenter tip blunting [16], superficial oxide layer [17], indentation size effect (ISE) [18], may affect indentation properties, thus making difficult compare. However, MIIT mitigate mentioned detrimental superficial effects, especially ISE effect [19]. date, researcher working IIT focused nanoindentation investigate mechanical property ceramics, polymers, metallic materials. metallic materials, maximum nanoscale depth reach 0.2 microns, beneficial assessing mechanical property thin film coating [20,21,22]. hand, nIIT successfully utilized, specific reference SS 316L, inspect effect surface modifications, induced irradiation [23], pulsed plasma [24], nitriding [25], sol-gel thin coating [26], more. best authors’ knowledge, studies, except one published [27] fatigue behavior PBF-LB SS 316L different orientation (vertically, horizontally 45° angle) using Vickers instrumented macro-indentation, conducted elastoplastic behavior either SS 316L steel PBF-LB counterpart. author complemented result standard Vickers hardness (HV30) test, found highest vertically printed direction (229 ± 3) contrast lowest tensile strength (600 ± 1 MPa). Since primary goal explore plastic behavior PBF-LB SS 316L toward ultimate tensile strength (UTS), find direct relationship standard Vickers hardness, avoided referring existing study based spherical indentation testing would concerned elastoplastic behavior material near yield strength.A unique advantage MIIT nIIT sample le sensitive finishing method roughness levels, tested surface marginally affected (nm µm scale). Various metallic material investigated using Vickers MIIT measure elastic modulus hardness-block made martensitic stainless steel [28], yield stress, work hardening exponent 316L 420 steel implementing FEM genetic algorithm P-h data [29], indentation modulus creep stainless steel reference block, Al alloy, copper alloy, Cu-Cr-Zr alloy [30], more. Although MIIT effected ISE, still several factor influence measured property great extent, Vickers indenter tip blunting effect γ-TiAl alloy [31], FEM-based research effect surface roughness macro-spherical indentation P-h curve SS 316L [32], investigating residual stress Vickers macro-indentation HY80 HY100 steel weld [33]. However, large peak load might result excessive damage highly finished engineering products, due large imprints. Thus, trade-off load value selected minimize surface damage avoiding ISE effects, provide macroscopic material response equivalent tensile/compression test. Although nIIT MIIT individually independently investigated various studies, rarely combined share relative benefits, instance [20,21,22]. dual-scale correlation suitable building prototype virtually free common defect (e.g., pores, oxides, inclusions, lack fusion), case considered here. Therefore, systematic investigation scale PBF-LB SS 316L sample beneficial help cross-link material property different length scales, i.e., indent region several grain within individual grains. provision tensile-like property PBF-LB SS 316L offer useful baseline benchmarking different scanning strategy manufacturing processes. MIIT, even though much le common nIIT, paramount importance industry engineering tensile property play leading role national international engineering design standards. Moreover, nIIT MIIT used PBF-LB, accelerate process setup ass structural performance quality final products, respectively. current study, PBF-LB fabricated block supplied PBF-LB device manufacturer extensive research devoted finding optimal PBF-LB process window produce advanced cost-effective SS 316L part use biomedical transportation industry. paper organized three sections, namely, Material Methods, Results, Discussion. latter section, turn, divided two subsections: Section 4.1 first discus relationship emerging nano- macro-indentation property end recognizing lack useful mean elucidate anomaly inconsistency observed among indentation properties; Section 4.2, briefly introducing topic residual stress contest IIT, re-examines possible cause anomaly new perspective account breakdown fundamental condition full elastic contact indenter investigated material upon unloading (ISO 14577-1,2 [14,34]). new approach illustrated interpret IIT phenomenon concurrently affected residual stresses. criterion discern whether measured indentation property impaired residual stress also presented. 2.

Schematic location n.3 MIIT Y-Z X-Y plane (dark diamonds); inset show n.9 nIIT (3 × 3 matrix 26 × 26 µm2 square yellow) location X-Y plane. characteristic scale SS 316L steel microstructure assessed using optical micrographs (DMI 3000 M, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) scanning electron microscope (TESCANS 9000 G, Tescan group, Brno, Czech Republic). microstructure surveyed thoroughly mean optical (by using 5× 100× magnifying objective lenses) scanning electron microscopy (1500× 12,000× magnification 20 kV) reveal relevant microstructure feature different location build confirm absence porosity processing defect found optimal process conditions. Indeed, sample essentially appeared free visible defects, except sporadic micro- submicron-sized spherical pores. uncertain whether pore induced PBF-LB or, seems likely, corrosion pitting caused search optimal etching condition.

Prior nIIT (Hisytron TI 950 TriboIndenter, Berkovich indenter, Massachusetts, US) MIIT (Zwick Röell ZHU 2.5, Vickers indenter, Ulm, Germany), respective indentation device calibrated respect instrument compliance standard [34]. MIIT device also equipped optical microscope allows simultaneous reading Vickers indent diagonal complete unloading. peak load 150 N selected trade-off fulfill restriction narrow width deposit (Figure 2). However, load (25, 100, 400, 500, 700, 1000 1200 N) also investigated. study, 150 N load case (30 holding time, 1 N/s loading, 4 N/s unloading rates) examined detail three macro-indents, X-Y Y-Z planes, located sufficient depth along deposit outline region hemispherical cap. depth consistent minimum distance indent surface (~3.5 d, diagonal Vickers indent), mean thickness deposited layer (~600 µm). convenience, ten repeated MIIT cycle performed indent location, using peak load. MIIT analysis generally utilizes indentation data deduced first cycle unless detailed information requested clarify elastoplastic behavior material. hardness value obtained using diagonal reading defined equivalent macro Vickers hardness (HVeq) broadly related standard macro Vickers hardness [39]. hardness resulting MIIT hereinafter denoted term macro-indentation hardness (HIT). HVeq differs HIT respective definition contact area, is, lateral contact area complete unloading former, projected contact area loading latter. definition assume perfect pyramidal geometry indent. Thus, HVeq expressed term HIT, provided latter corrected equivalent lateral contact area residual imprint (i.e., 0.094 factor). hardness denoted hereinafter residual indentation hardness (HITR GPa).The nIIT survey performed maximum load 5 mN (10 holding time 50 µN s−1 loading/unloading rate cycle). extensive nIIT grid mapping survey performed across various region deposit, including core, X-Y plane (with tip directed along build direction, Z-axis). Nine representative nICs selected center deposit, covering area 26 × 26 µm2, representative deposit core grain (see Figure 2). worth noticing nanoindentation test applied 20 grain (selected random) X-Y plane core deposit, result revealed mean value indentation modulus range 160.8 ± 7.3 GPa likely depending orientation grains. However, isolated grain exhibited even much larger smaller value 160.8 GPa. result, although based small group grains, indicates PBF-LB grain preferentially grow Y-Z plane along <101> direction influence <100> direction. grain anisotropy confirmed another study based EBSD SS 316L alloy (see result discussion section details). sake brevity, nanoindentation result within one single grain reported work. 3.

Discussion 4.1. Ante Fact: Correlation Nano- Macro-Indentation PropertiesLaser fabrication method expose initial powder localized energy promote rapid melting solidification. observed microstructure due large thermal gradient [42] variation cooling rate. selected laser scanning strategy, based alternating layers, produced typical Y-Z plane microstructure etching (Figure 3a,b) made alternating stripe (of thickness ≈60 ≈50 µm) overlapped semi-circular curved melting fronts. Figure 3c,d show cellular structure (average cell size 2 µm) embedded much larger columnar grains, prominently observable curved solidification front evolve along Y-axis scanning direction. Much smaller cell (smaller 2 µm) also observed near outer surface deposit. elongated grain driven large thermal gradient build perpendicular advancing curved solidification front. Similar microstructure morphology reported researcher identical PBF-LB SS 316L steel [43]. Additionally, typical equiaxed grain observed layer semi-circular solidification front advancing along X-axis scanning direction. Overlapping curved layer cause grain growth underneath equiaxed grain within semi-circular X-direction layer [44], equiaxed elongated grain also observed top side view investigating L-PBF fabricated 316L. optical micrograph (Figure 3e,f) microstructure Y-Z plane, without etching, reveals characteristic dendric branching structure made coarse grain relatively wide aspect ratio (10 100). elastoplastic property microstructure sensed, nIIT, superficial single grain level (similar single crystal) core deposit and, MIIT, across bulky polycrystalline structure along boundary deposit. anomaly shown nICs loading low load (Figure 4) attributed initial elastic interaction indenter tip material (e.g., due oxide film) gradually becomes unstable (slope change) degenerate abnormal inelastic displacement critical load. Berkovich indenter responsible essential elastoplastic behavior material critical load. assumed, discussed later, initial anomaly influence characteristic elastoplastic behavior material larger loads. striking feature nICs prominent large shift on-loading maximum penetration depth (204–235 nm) and, consequently, upon unloading. Table 1 show that, spite possible influence ISE nIIT [18,45], measured nHIT (3.2 ± 0.13) nearly constant within nanoscale probed region. consistent presence homogeneous solid solution austenitic grain (nearly single crystals). measured nIIT hardness value compare well 3.4 GPa reported [46], nIIT performed, depth control, maximum penetration 800 nm (about four time maximum depth study). Zhai et al. [47] reported nIIT hardness value 3.12 ± 0.14 GPa similar material performing nIIT 1000 nm maximum depth (nearly five time maximum depth considered study). Zeng et al. [48] performed nIIT similarly fabricated SS 316L peak load 50 mN (10 time higher ours) reported nano-hardness value 3.25 ± 5 GPa. However, previously mentioned nHIT value much larger 1.95–2.03 GPa found Khodabakhshi et al. [49] peak load 200 mN (40 time greater used current study). already noted, measured indentation hardness indentation modulus nano-scale seem uncorrelated measured macroscopic properties, likely due intrinsic anisotropic property 316L large grain [27,46]. Hausild et al. [50] fact showed large anisotropy effect single crystal conventional SS 316L (~120 GPa (001), 200 GPa (101) 280 GPa (111) planes. Moreover, conducted systematic investigation addressed nanoscale indentation property large (single crystal) grain SS 316L alloy produced laser powder bed fusion, considering different grain orientation build planes. proved significant influence nanoindentation hardness indentation modulus texture orientation grains. confirmed, present study, relatively coarse grain PBF-LB 316L alloy behave single crystals, thereby exhibiting intrinsic elastic anisotropic properties. undesirable effect ISE clearly manifest nHIT compared HIT values, shown Table 1 Table 2. measured value Hit Eit 1.7 ± 0.1 117.7 ± 29.7 GPa, respectively. reference work [51], noticed ISE-free measured nHIT range compare well HIT range rather nHIT one. dispersion HIT nHIT value found equivalent, Eit value much dispersed nEIT counterparts. show Hit Eit somehow correlated, nHit nEit not. far macroscale concerned, behavior cannot ascribed ISE eventual superficial artefacts, le influence large depth order 60 µm. equivalent Vickers hardness 186.71 ± 5.03 range 162.67 ± 2.87 HV15 range two plane follow trend HIT. worth noting that, although HIT measured loading/holding, Vickers hardness relies residual indenting, i.e., complete unloading. measured equivalent Vickers hardness compared literature value PBF-LB SS 316L steel, although latter value refer different process conditions. instance, found [52] value 220–225 HV10, Ref. [53] reported value 223–245 HV30, Ref. [54] measured value 215–255 HV, Ref. [55] obtained value 325 ± 15 HV1. macro-Vickers range reported reference slightly larger found here. study, porosity chemical composition excluded factor primary influence, considered texture, microstructure, important factor may come play. Regrettably, macro-indentation testing common research, best authors’ knowledge, useful macro-Vickers IIT data found given 316L alloy could used comparison purposes. Nevertheless, indirect comparison could made comparing estimated UTS-like value (581.1 ± 55.06 593.3 ± 40.8 MPa X-Y Y-Z planes, respectively), listed Table 2 UTS found researchers, is, 595–635 [35], 509–668 [36], 540–630 [55], 511–698 [53], 555–690 [54], 572.8 ± 0.6 [56] as-built PBF-LB 316L alloy. good match would seem encourage use MIIT hardness deduce representative tensile-like property polycrystalline PBF-LB product absence specific macro-Vickers IIT data could used comparison purposes. However, lower UTS value 503 MPa estimated may appear suspicious, particularly associated relatively low value HIT EIT. sudden drop UTS cannot ascribed microstructure heterogeneity internal defects, significant chemical composition change detected EDS marked porosity inclusion observed, even high magnification. comparison measured EIT Young’s modulus attempted. typical value polycrystalline SS 316L alloy, produced mean conventional manufacturing, 180–190 GPa range. Kurzynowski et al. [37] Chao et al. [56] reported tensile property SS 316L produced mean PBF-LB, stress-relief heat treatments, including authors. reported Young’s modulus value generally number quite widespread, is, 219 GPa PBF-LB [37], 169–212 GPa stress relief heat treatment [37], 195 GPa PBF-LB [57], 150–193 PBF-LB [58]. data compared EIT value shown Table 2, appear slightly larger Y-Z plane (174.38 ± 10.49 GPa), markedly larger X-Y plane (122.84 ± 10.15 GPa). Since Young’s modulus polycrystalline material microstructure-insensitive property, difference EIT two plane alloy appears unsound; therefore, investigation required. notable aspect interest abnormal plastic deformation pattern observed Figure 3f around residual macro-indents Y-Z plane, 700 N peak load. Figure 3e show microstructure Figure 3f, indentation. indented area cover several coarse grains. plastic strain seem effectively accommodated coarse grains, favorably oriented toward top bottom right edges, whereas grain bottom-left edge barely affected. crack observed top-left edge, unusual SS 316L alloy, expected ductile. crack attributed unforeseen tensile residual stress (TRS). Although residual stress various type quite common strongly non-equilibrium PBF-LB build [59,60,61,62], presumed multiple slicing polishing sample led complete relaxation RS, thus, could ignored study plan. Figure 3f, hand, offer evident counterproof presence TRS, which, among others, could explain origin anomaly measured indentation property dispersion.An attempt made next section reassess overall range indentation property considering presence RS PBF-LB SS 316L steel sample. serf rationalize effect RS measured indentation property ultimately verify reliability.A in-depth inspection value listed Table 2 revealed anomalies, relevant much smaller diagonal length X-Y plane Y-Z plane (390 vs. 415 µm), spite identical peak load used planes.Moreover, trend equivalent Vickers hardness (HVeq) follow HIT, although distinction made former latter based respective definitions. Indeed, former pure plasticity index determined mean value two measured Vickers diagonal (fifth sixth columns) residual imprint. latter instead lumped elastoplastic index determined using area function (derived priori calibration indenter standard reference material), computed attained maximum penetration depth.When RRS present across sample, two index sense material different ways. residual imprint, linked HVeq, determined ultimate inelastic response material including relaxation initial RRS. Conversely, HIT sens direct interplay (elastic) RRS elastoplastic indentation phenomenon underneath indenter. perspective, two hardness index become lumping parameters, which, addition conventional contributions, also include different effect RRS. interesting see, Table 2, largest maximum penetration depth always consistent lowest HIT X-Y Y-Z planes, thereby confirming acceptable constancy parameter (including UTS-like parameter) versus RRS. However, HIT often uncorrelated HVeq planes. indent either plane may occasionally exhibit significant difference diagonal length (equal larger 12 µm). general mismatch indentation data fully reflected anomalous value EIT indents, believed main indicator RRS sample. examination Table 2 also suggests main difference indentation parameter two plane macro-indents attributed different microstructure morphology, heterogeneities, anisotropy, instead distinct role played RRS. 4.2. Post Fact: Influence Residual Stress Macro-Indentation PropertiesThe study RS mean IIT subject current active research [62,63]. Although several method proposed, none free application difficulty [62,63]. Indeed, many require priori determination zero-stress reference state, often unknown [62,63]. Moreover, experimental validation, e.g., mean X-ray diffraction similar, difficult greatest depth interest study (60 μm). Thus, although main goal study determine tensile-like property PBF-LB 316L alloy mean MIIT, another goal determine whether measured indentation property true RS-invalidated ones. RS new playing factor, unloading anomaly shown Figure 5a could also consequence free distortion sample upon RS relaxation MIIT unloading rather unlike accidental sample preparation.Before analyzing new indentation data, issue RS metal alloy briefly introduced, salient result attained far summarized, new experimental strategy presented along necessary working assumptions. experimental IIT result discussed previous section nanoscale macroscale comply ISO 14577-1,2 procedure, assumes presence pure elastic contact interface indenter surface material upon incipient unloading. implicitly implies absence RS material. Moreover, RS may induce sink-in pile-up phenomena, phenomenon covered code either. Thus, presence RS PBF-LB fabricated SS 316L alloy, invoked standard procedure may provide inaccurate results. Chen et al. [44] classified residual stress three categories: type I, macroscale caused plastic deformation gradients, type II III, found microscale atomic levels. Type II associated grain intergranular manner owing strain incompatibility among grains, type III associated grain intragranular manner, dislocated cell within grain, respectively. Accordingly [44,64], type residual stress pertinent study measured MIIT. Expectedly, owing prior slicing polishing operations, original RS imparted PBF-LB process investigated deposit relaxed extent, hence, denoted hereinafter remnant residual stress-strain field (RRS).Tsui et al. [65] simulated standard indentation process mean finite element method proved indentation hardness indentation modulus increase compressive residual stress increase, decrease tensile residual stress increase. However, fundamental knowledge Young’s modulus material indicates remain approximately unaffected change microstructures fabrication method. indentation data listed Table 2 complemented derived repeated macro-Vickers IIT indentation (under constant peak load, indent) better elucidate role RS relaxation behavior upon indentation PBF-LB 316L alloy. Previous researcher successfully used repeated macro-Vickers IIT indentation improve measurement accuracy indentation modulus various metals, especially low strain hardening ability [66]. difference indentation property two plane expected due different type RS originated PBF-LB process different cut performed original deposit. simplicity, assume RRS purely elastic. larger lower value EIT Young’s modulus provide index sign (i.e., compressive tensile, respectively) RRS [64].The EIT value listed Table 2 X-Y plane much lower Y-Z plane. plane also show lower EIT value Young’s modulus. initially ascribe discrepancy influence tensile RRS present PBF-LB 316L alloy sample [65]. presence tensile RRS reported PBF-LB fabricated 316L alloy [67]. typically caused large thermal gradient large cooling rate [37]. Tensile RRS alter measured indentation curve (IC) causing marked shift right loading segment IC shift left unloading segment IC [62,63]. HIT closely linked residual strains, first approximation, considered insensitive residual stresses. consistency HIT across sample appreciated matching observed estimated UTS-like parameter (≈HIT/3) UTS value PBF-LB 316L alloy literature. HIT depends maximum penetration depth (hM), may useful parameter sense in-depth RRS. study, alternative hardness index, is, HVeq, introduced.HVeq resembles standard HV utilizes procedure determine residual lateral contact area. However, HVeq differs standard HV employ MIIT cycle rather standard HV cycle.In work, HIT HVeq index interpreted different light associated RRS. main difference standard HIT HVeq concern contact area, is, projected contact area HIT lateral contact area HVeq. major difference lie indentation cycle. former determined upon loading/holding, typically sens elastoplastic property material. latter determined complete unloading, hence, represents pure plasticity index material. However, RRS present sample, two index provide quite different outcomes. case HIT, competition occurs elastoplastic field induced indenter interfering elastic RRS. Thus, HIT measure combined effect phenomena. Even though assume identical loading–holding cycle HVeq used HIT, upon complete release indentation load, detected lateral contact area residual imprint account combined effect indentation hardening, eventual elastic relaxation, relaxation RRS (if any). conventional meaning HVeq may modified great extent, depending relative importance initial tensile RRS indentation plasticity phenomena. tensile RRS dominant, large in-plane permanent displacement accompanied incomplete strain hardening, result misleading HVeq. Alternatively, initial RRS substantially relaxed indentation, thereby allowing sufficient indentation strain hardening, HVeq result conventional hardness index. Moreover, standard HV HVeq mask presence large tensile RRS, caution therefore taken using mean value two Vickers diagonals, especially large difference diagonal detected.The difference residual Vickers diagonal considered indicator in-plane two-dimensional tensile RRS. Although compressive RRS expected induce relatively small diagonal differences, tensile RRS responsible much larger values. Furthermore, small diagonal difference necessarily imply negligible RRS. instance, compressive RRS one direction may relate tensile RRS orthogonal direction confine net deformation underneath indenter. Alternatively, indenter diagonal may accidentally aligned along RRS-balanced directions, thereby resulting negligible diagonal differences. Table 2 show diagonal difference measured X-Y Y-Z plane range 12 15 μm, mean plane affected tensile RRS, also attested low value EIT indents.With reference repeated indentations, change EIT HIT nth indentation cycle computed respect first cycle. change indentation modulus indentation hardness computed as: Eit(n) − Eit(1) = ΔEit(n), Hit(n) − Hit(1) = ΔHit(n), respectively. Figure 6c Figure 6d show change two indentation property ten cycle [14,34]. Figure 6. Multi-cycle (10 cycles) plot (a) EIT cycle X−Y Y−Z planes, (b) HIT cycle six indent X−Y Y−Z planes, (c) progressive increase EIT, respect increase first cycle (diff-EIT), (d) progressive decrease HIT respect decrease first cycle (diff-HIT). absence RRS, repeated Vickers indentation promote fully developed plasticity condition attained (also called Tabor’s condition), reached upon IIT loading [66], especially metal alloy exhibit poor strain hardening ability. presence RRS, repeated Vickers indentation expected relax RRS extent via plasticity developed underneath indenter. Table 2 show two measured diagonal residual Vickers imprint (5th 6th columns) X-Y Y-Z surfaces. result listed Table 2 one repeated Vickers indentation X-Y Y-Z plane discussed hereafter.It recalled deposit relatively thin along y-direction, deposition vector along z much smaller along x direction; thus, in-plane σy (residual stress) (see Figure 7) assumed negligible comparison σx σz; moreover, alternate overlying Y-deposit layer tend relax area underneath σy result tempering.

HVeq provides index unrelaxed tensile RRS upon IIT, thus, measure extent indentation property affected RRS. three macro-indents lying X-Y plane located large distance substrate–deposit interface. distance ensures: (i) in-depth σz act three indents, (ii) chemical inhomogeneity (e.g., due dilution filler substrate) negligible, (iii) thermal condition indent mainly depends local cooling rate (CR). active residual stress X-Y plane in-plane σx in-depth σz.

Nanoindentation testing X-Y plane showed grain nearly stress free little common indentation property macroscale. measured indentation modulus unaffected grain boundaries, characteristic intrinsic elastic anisotropy individual grain revealed. nanoindentation hardness vary great extent across individual grains, although suffered large ISE. Macro-indentation imprint large grain Y-Z (growth) X-Y (scanning) plane PBF-LB deposit showed indentation hardness affected le ISE provides reliable estimate UTS-like (≈HIT/3) SS 316L.Abnormal value indentation property macroscale, equivalent Vickers hardness indentation modulus, indicated need reexamine overall indentation result considering influence residual stress deposit. presence residual stress indented sample implied lack justification basic requirement contained current ISO 14577-1 code, therefore, appropriate meaning outcome traditional material parameter needed reconsideration.It found HIT provided useful index could used sense in-depth residual stresses, whereas difference residual Vickers diagonal (whenever available) could used sense in-plane stresses. Compressive residual stresses, even combined tensile stresses, effective relaxing upon indentation tended ensure reliable indentation properties; conversely, tensile stress found le effective relaxing prone invaliding indentation results.The developed methodology permit influence residual stress measured indentation property macroscale rationalized reliability measured indentation property systematically discriminated.

IntroductionAdditive manufacturing (AM) 3D printing become indispensable tool fabricate complex geometries, often difficult manufacture conventional techniques. process offer cost reduction, product process redesign, lead time reduction, flexibility manufacture part desired material property [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]]. Additive manufacturing evolved mere prototyping tooling technique direct part manufacturing method past year [6]. wide variety material processed AM, including titanium, stainless steel, aluminum, nickel-based superalloys, etc. [[7], [8], [9], [10]].Selective laser melting (SLM) technique scanning laser used melt along certain direction powder bed. Typically, high cooling rate high thermal gradient achieved SLM process, result highly anisotropic solidification melt pool [11]. thermal gradient solidification front velocity used predict microstructural growth morphology, cooling rate determines size dendrite formed. Process parameter laser power, scan speed, hatch spacing, scanning strategies, even sample orientation build plate reported significantly alter crystallographic texture process [[12], [13], [14], [15]]. crystalline texture known affect, e.g., mechanical corrosion property component, control used manufacture part desired material property [16]. Several author discussed impact laser scanning strategy obtained texture Ni-based alloys. example, unidirectional laser scanning found result fiber texture, bidirectional scanning laser gave rise rotated cube-like texture printed component [17]. Furthermore, switching transverse anisotropic isotropic vice-versa demonstrated SLM IN738 [18]. Crystallographic texture control nickel-base superalloy Inconel 718 demonstrated varying energy density input powder bed using different electron beam scan strategy locally change grain orientation precise location as-build component [19]. strong influence laser scanning strategy texture also observed processing wide range metal alloy [[20], [21], [22]].One common alloy 316L SS, influence scan strategy texture reported Wei et al.

Furthermore, recent study Andreau et al. effect gas flow direction laser scanning crystallographic texture 316L SS discussed [24]. observed crystallographic texture appeared dependent relative direction laser scanning gas flow, attributed absorbing effect metal vapor plume. Scanning direction gas flow found affect depth melt pool, due local attenuation laser beam's effective energy density transmitted powder bed.The aim work demonstrate laser scanning strategy used control texture SLM, even obtaining single crystal 316L SS. microstructure crystallographic texture formed process correlated mechanical properties. use laser scanning strategy control final shape part simultaneously imprint predesigned spatially resolved crystallographic grain orientation pattern SLM process also demonstrated.2.

Young's modulus observed change scanning strategy 129 ± 3 GPa (Z-scan) 193 ± 16 GPa (67°Rot-scan), illustrated Table 1. Since Young's modulus depends strength density interatomic forces, value sensitive atomic arrangement along specific crystallographic direction [58]. general, elastic modulus varies interatomic distance single crystal, FCC system, ordered accordingly E [111] > E [110] > E [100] [59,60].

Stress vs. strain as-printed 316L SS different scanning strategies. direction applied load along Z-axis, illustrated green arrow insets.The mechanical property sample appear strongly influenced presence intragranular cellular structures. observed cellular structure formed, see Fig. 9(b, c, d) result high cooling rate non-equilibrium condition SLM process [49]. morphology cellular structure size cell influenced laser scanning strategies, specifically, resulting temperature gradient laser melting process.The cellular structure exists columnar grain present intragranular feature. Hence, cellular structure cannot interpreted grain structure adjacent cell similar crystallographic orientation, previously reported elsewhere [49]. Although cellular structure cannot considered grains, play significant role acting barrier dislocation motion deformation. Hall-Petch type correlation tensile strength intragranular cell spacing previously reported [50,51]. yield strength ultimate tensile strength showed linear correlation reciprocal square root intragranular cellular spacing, indicating importance cellular structure strengthening selectively laser melted 316L SS components.The size cellular structure formed SLM different scanning strategy determined using ‘area method’ described above. mean cellular size found vary 0.76 μm 0.40 μm, illustrated Table 1. However, Hall-Petch type correlation yield ultimate tensile strength intragranular cell spacing observed present study. could due influence two factor (Taylor factor porosity) discussed below;The variation yield strength related variation Taylor factor, ‘M’ [52], related flow stress σ by:(3)σ=MαbGρ1/2where ‘b’ absolute value Burgers vector, ‘G’ shear modulus, ρ total dislocation density, α constant order 0.2–0.35 [53,54]. Since Taylor factor orientation factor depends texture material crystallographic nature assumed slip systems, material higher Taylor factor require greater axial stress plastically deformed [55]. Taylor factor distribution as-processed sample different scanning strategy along loading direction (Z-axis) evaluated EBSD (see supplementary Fig. S5). Taylor factor distribution mainly 2.3 2.6 〈100〉 textured sample (Z-scan strategy) along loading direction (Z-axis). fiber textured sample (Rot-scan), distribution Taylor factor became broader average value 3, along loading direction (Z-axis). Meanwhile, increase fraction grain Taylor factor 3.4 observed 〈110〉 textured sample (Y-scan strategy) along loading direction (Z-axis). Taylor factor minimum 〈100〉 crystallographic texture cubic material (see supplementary Fig. S5(a)), partly explain lower yield strength observed as-printed sample 〈100〉 crystallographic texture [56,57]. Meanwhile, marginal increase ultimate tensile strength sample 〈100〉 texture, pulled along Z-axis, could due formation columnar lamellar microstructure (CLM) observed indicated black arrow Fig. 5(a) Fig. 7(a). formation microstructural feature found first time Sun et al. selective laser melting austenitic stainless steel [16]. similar microstructural feature CLM layer observed sample Z-scan strategy, presented study.

Particularly variation value weld time 1 weld time 2 reported significant change nugget macrograph. observed that, various combination lower welding time electrode force, nugget showed internal pore (sample Nos. 3, 10, 14, 15, 18, 19, 30) due inadequate mixing. Also, sample 4 (extreme low weld time 1) sample 6 (extreme low weld time 2), shallow nugget lower indentation recorded due insufficient welding times. Lower welding time resulted lower heat generated reduced molten nugget volume leaded shallow nugget. Also, sheet ductility le due low heat generated, low electrode indentation produced sheet surfaces. mid level combination welding time electrode force (sample Nos. 2, 5, 7, 8, 13, 21); average nugget, TS strength indentation recorded without internal defects. also observed sample higher nugget size (sample Nos. 1, 12, 24, 32) belonged higher welding time showed higher value TS strength indentations. sample 23 (extreme low electrode force), shallow nugget formed due inadequate value electrode force. However; it’s high value caused drifting sheet surface metal shown sample 25 (extreme high electrode force) made weaker decreasing energy absorption capacity due material loss. squeeze time hold time, macrographs respective extreme low high axial level shown sample 16 17 sample 31 22. Variation two affect weld characteristic much significant difference macrographs TS strength value observed extreme low high levels.Apart macrographic study, observation also recorded TS failure samples. Based this, important finding related failure mode sheet separation characteristic summarised follows: Three type failure mode observed interfacial, partial interfacial partial pullout nugget pullout (single sheet nugget pullout, sheet nugget pullout without tearing sheets); value TS strength increased interfacial pullout failure. noted that, various lower value combination welding time electrode force resulted interfacial failure minimum TS strength (sample Nos. 4, 14, 15, 23, 30). sample showed shallow weak nugget due inadequate welding time electrode force. Interfacial failure took place sample due fact that, lower welding time resulted lower heat input due incomplete mixing bonding occurred thus; failure took place contact interface overlapped sheet minimum TS strength. Careful observation sample showed failure occurred nugget, along plane parallel sheet surfaces. shallow weak nugget formed, shear force along parallel faying sheet surface sufficient enough act driving force produce interfacial failure. Moreover; interfacial failure showed little plastic deformation sheet surface pointed towards minimum deformation resistance offered sheets.Aloft value welding time produced nugget pullout sheet showed higher value TS strength without internal pore (sample Nos. 11, 29). sample strong nugget formed sample showed partial tearing sheet also. However; high value electrode force desired produced surface drifting sheet material shown sample No. 25. addition, condition expanded nugget laterally, due thinning material loss, TS strength RSW joint decreased. Variation TS strength failure mode affected much squeeze time hold time identical breaking pattern observed sample Nos. 16 17; 31 22 representing respective extreme low high level values. sample single nugget pullout failure, failure initiated customarily top sheet (sample Nos. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 18, 19, 20, 26, 27, 31) sample showed intermediate value TS strength interfacial sheet nugget pullout failures. happened due fact that, RSW upper electrode moving lower stationary, thus higher impact load transferred top sheet made comparatively weaker bottom sheet.Also, nugget pullout failures, sample pullout sheet well tearing base metal (sample Nos. 1, 12, 24, 32) showed highest value TS strength. samples, failure occurred around nugget leaving area like button showing that, material yielded away weld nugget; implying nugget much higher strength base metal (BM). Also, unlike interfacial failure, tensile force driving force produce nugget pullout sheets. Due strong nugget formation, applied force produced necking sheet tensile force acted resultant engender pullout failure. addition; pullout failure showed le plastic deformation tearing sheet surface en routed towards substantial deformation resistance offered sheets. Thus, selected parameters, one make judgement based failure modes, concluded that, sample showing interfacial failure rejected pullout failure mode accepted engineering applications.4 Mathematical modeling statistical analysis TS strengthThough experimental observation skimmed performance RSW joint provided important information related weld characteristic behaviour, detailed analysis must predict quality dispense effect parameter numeric terms. same, experimental data Table 3 exploited using RSM determine relationship interaction various input parameter TS strength. second order response surface model developed evaluate parametric effect formulated given below:$$y={\beta }_{0}+\sum_{i=1}^{k}{\beta }_{i}{x}_{i}+\sum_{i=1}^{k}{\beta }_{ii}{x}_{i}^{2}+\sum \sum_{i F’ far le 0.05. Higher F-value lower P-value implied selected model adequate enough predict response le 0.01% chance large F-value due noise.

R2 (0.9316) confirmed used TS prediction given range input parameters. Adequate precision 43.277, greater desired value i.e. 4, implying considerable difference significant insignificant parameter (Fig. 2).Table 4 ANOVA table TS strengthFull size tableFig. 2SEM photograph RSW specimenFull size imageAs experimentation parameter experimental runs, also equal importance verify model distribution error terms. same, normal probability plot residual drawn shown Fig. 3 revealed residual located least-square line estimating cumulative distribution function population. evident figure, residual located near straight line mean error normally distributed serious violation assumption underlie analysis [34]. displaying satisfactory normal distribution, normality assumption made earlier confirmed concluded predictive regression model extracted information available experimental data [35].Fig. 3Normal plot residual TS strengthFull size image5 Result discussionThe macrographic failure analysis showed good weld higher value weld time average electrode force macro level. However; characteristic spot weld producing higher TS strength understood micro level also. same, micrographic evaluation performed scanning electron microscope (SEM) image recorded sample No. 32 highest TS strength. Figure 2(a) represents cross-sectional micrograph welded region along point micro level observation perceived. micrographs, central nugget area shown Fig. 2(b) showed sound defect-free nugget, complete penetration mixing BMs. also observed that, nugget elongation parallel electrode compression direction partition top bottom sheets. Figure 2(c) showed clear transition line nugget BM small HAZ. high welding times, complete melting mixing BMs occurred, thus clear transition line small HAZ observed. addition, clearly seen molten nugget flow orientation parallel weld heat flow concentrated towards centre. Also, grain direction totally different BM nugget.Figure 2(d) showed enlarged view micrograph electrode sheet contact interface three distinct regains observed base figure nugget, HAZ BM; clear separation line observed top sheet BM surface HAZ. Also, separation line parallel electrode indentation produced surface BM sheet. more, magnification Fig. 2(d) point ‘e’ depicted Fig. 2(e) revealed that, internal micro-expulsion took place along BM HAZ interface due high electrode force may increase increase electrode force. Figure 2(f) show micrograph base material (SS316L). Also, seen that, due thermal gradient, HAZ irregular increased grain size compared nugget given Fig. 2 (d) (e). Still, HAZ small large defect free nugget observed, condition may conveyed spot weld order good TS strength.Apart model significance, Table 4 summarized significant parameters, effect interaction also. Table 4, concluded that, TS strength highly affected weld time 1, weld time 2 electrode force. aforementioned parameter significantly affected TS strength P-values (< 0.0001) far le 0.05, however; weld time 1 highly effective followed weld time 2 electrode force F-values 1332, 501.15 77.42 respectively. Squeeze time hold time found insignificant prediction TS strength P-values greater 0.05 i.e. 0.0915 0.2863 respectively. Table 4 also showed interaction ‘weld time 1 weld time 2’ ‘weld time 1 electrode force’ significant significant interaction, respectively TS strength.Other interaction ‘squeeze time hold time’, ‘squeeze time weld time 1’, ‘squeeze time electrode force’, ‘weld time 1 hold time’ ‘hold time weld time 2’ also found significant predicting TS strength RSW joints. However; interaction ‘squeeze time electrode force’, ‘hold time electrode force’ ‘weld time 2 electrode force’ found insignificant. Among quadratic terms, significant term electrode force weld time 1, quadratic term hold time found insignificant TS strength prediction. prediction individual parameter effect TS strength, perturbation plot drawn varying one parameter time keeping others constant shown Fig. 4. seen TS strength highly affected weld time 1 weld time 2, respectively increased value increased. electrode force, TS strength initially increased deceased towards maximum value. Squeeze time hold time showed slight adverse effect TS strength.Fig. 4Perturbation plot showing effect parameter TS strengthFull size imageAlong effect individual parameters, important interaction affecting TS strength presented shown Fig. 5. Interaction ‘weld time 1 weld time 2’ shown Fig. 5(a) predicted higher value parameter maximum value TS strength. Higher weld time desired confirmed uniform melting sheet metal ensured proper fusion integrity sheets. heat generated increased weld time increased, resulted melting mixing metals, thus TS strength joint increased weld times. hand, low weld times, lower heat generated molten metal get sufficient time distribute heat uniformly thus produced joint low TS strength. Figure 5(b) showed interaction ‘weld time 1 electrode force’ predicted higher value weld time 1 however; electrode force, TS strength increased initially decreased electrode force increased towards maximum value. predicted near mid-level value electrode force, low electrode force, sheet grasped firmly gap contact resistance caused interfacial expulsion pores. hand, high value electrode force resulted displacement loss sheet surface metal produced thinning BMs. Also, higher electrode force, weakening base metal took place due excessive impact load.Fig. 5Interaction effect parameter TS strengthFull size imageMoreover; excessive electrode force constrained thermal expansion nugget volume, reduced nugget area thus affected TS strength RSW joints. interaction ‘squeeze time hold time’ shown Fig. 5(c) predicted lower value maximum value TS strength. lower value predicted due fact that, lower squeeze time, effective electrode force maintained constant ensured firm contact sheets. Lower hold time ensured passing second current pulse weld time 2 immediately weld time 1. so, heat generated weld time 1 lost thus; helped weld time 2 expand nugget increased TS strength joint. interaction ‘squeeze time weld time 1’ shown Fig. 5(d) also depicts higher value weld time 1 lower value squeeze time maximum value TS strength, however; effect squeeze time le compared weld time 1. Figure 5(e) showed interaction ‘squeeze time weld time 2’ also predicted higher value weld time 2 lower value squeeze time maximizing TS strength joints. interaction graph nearly similar nature interaction ‘squeeze time weld time 1 (as shown Fig. 5d) however; surface Fig. 5(d) step indicating one effective. Moreover; interaction squeeze time showed minimal effect TS strength. Figure 5(f) showed interaction ‘weld time 1 hold time’ higher weld time 1 lower hold time predicted maximum value TS strength. Higher weld time 1 predicted satisfying hypothesis, interaction predicted lower value hold time ensured immediate passing current weld time 2. so, reduced cooling rate molten metal, made metal softer thus helped weld time 2 increase nugget dimension lead increase TS strength joint.After analyzing model, necessary predict setting parameter TS strength maximum. same, numerical optimization tool available DesignExpert software applied prediction optimum parameters. desired goal criterion optimization selected TS strength parameter respectively, shown Table 5. optimum value parameter predicted solution generated, best solution maximum value TS strength selected shown Table 6. given table, actual value parameter predicted fractions, however; setting RSW machine, near possible feasible value parameter selected.

Along parametric effects, important conclusion also derived experimental observation cross-sectional macrographs failure characteristic specimens. Following conclusion enumerated present investigation. 1. low weld time 1, weld time 2 electrode force cross-sectional macrograph sample showed undersized nugget internal pores; hand, higher value resulted good nugget. However; excessive electrode force, drifting sheet surface material observed internal micro-expulsion. 2. increasing welding times, failure mode transferred solely interfacial nugget pullout tearing sheets.

Typically, higher laser power, heat increase causing powder melt melt pool, hence increase thickness specimen [25]. effect laser power materials’ tensile behavior shown Fig. 6 scanning speed 11 mm/sec.

UTS elongation maximum 900 (W) 11 mm/sec scanning speed. Lower laser power induces higher un-melted particle layer surface also responsible shrinkage. So, graph tends rise rise power higher laser power, higher chance gas porosity also mean higher thermal gradient. induces higher residual stress degrades mechanical properties. explains fall graph maximum laser power.Fig. 6Yield strength (MPa), ultimate tensile strength (MPa), elongation (%) VS.

Changes scanning speed cause variation bead size different deposition amount constant powder feed rate [27]. higher laser scanning speed, better tensile behavior trend go certain point [28]. rise scanning speed, granular bainite decrease improves grain boundary area. Thus, dislocation density increase higher speed; grain bainite size decrease due poor bonding deposition layer causing fall tensile strength [28]. specimen sorted five group based different scanning speeds, graph plotted scanning speed group three process parameter exhibit tensile behavior specimen particular scanning speed group.Both geometrical accuracy mechanical property printed part affected layer thickness, also referred vertical resolution [26]. average layer thickness specimen calculated considered one affecting parameters. effect layer thickness materials’ tensile behavior shown Fig. 6c.

RMSE, called mean_sqaure_error function library took square it, coefficient determination r2_score called directly respective library. relative error calculation manually imported metrics.The RMSEs obtained three output summarized Table 6, indicating aggregated mean deviation predicted value test data. XGBoost, deviation RMSE highest UTS (12.22) lowest elongation (%) (3.22). coefficient determination (R2) indicates well model fit training data. result show XGBoost model fitted 76% YS data, 72% UTS data, 85% elongation (%) data. Similarly, deviation RMSE highest UTS (20.01) lowest elongation (%) (4.28) RF. model fitted 69% YS data, 61% UTS data, 78% elongation (%) data. result relative error suggest relative uncertainty prediction actual value YS, UTS, elongation 2.81%, 3.23%, 0.89%, respectively, XGBoost. RF, value YS, UTS, elongation 3.65%, 3.9%, 2.09%, respectively, indicating XGBoost model outperformed Random Forest prediction.Table 6 Performance evaluation metric XGBoost RFFull size tableTo quantify uncertainty associated prediction, 95% confidence interval vertical \(\pm\) 2σ bar (σ = Standard deviation) used 95% predicted data run fell \(\pm\) 2σ limit. Therefore, confidence prediction represented using vertical \(\pm\) 2σ bars. Fig. 7a b, yield strength group 4 data predicted XGBoost RF model, respectively. graph followed trend fluctuation data. model predicted yield strength maximum laser power higher test data. might caused higher yield strength value particular laser power training set. Moreover, gap RMSE value model comparatively smaller. case UTS prediction Fig. 7c d, graph similar trend fluctuation (XGBoost RF, respectively). RMSEs obtained two model (XGBoost 12.22 & RF 20.01) higher two tensile property fluctuation training data UTS comparatively higher. graph Fig. 7c RMSE values, evident XGBoost handled fluctuation UTS data better RF. UTS value test data 900 W 1000 W fell inside confidence interval predicted data XGBoost gap RMSE value comparatively higher. case elongation (%), due le fluctuation training data, model performed better predict elongation (%) higher accuracy.

RR model fit data well. coefficient determination value − 59% YS data, − 51% UTS data, − 68% elongation (%) data. clearly indicated regression line forced move data points. relative uncertainty prediction actual value YS, UTS, elongation 2.07%, 4.01%, 1.85%, respectively. overall performance accuracy model good didn’t surpass either machine learning models. Unlike two ML models, failed follow trend test data.Table 7 performance evaluation metric Ridge RegressionFull size tableThe result suggest XGBoost better choice mechanical behavior prediction. One possible reason XGBoost first prune tree score called “similarity score” starting prediction [30]. considers gain function value node difference similarity score node similarity score child node. gain node found minimal, stop constructing tree greater depth control overfitting great extent. hand, Random Forest tends overfit data majority tree forest provided similar samples. XGBoost handle imbalanced data better Random Forest. XGBoost tends put highest significance functional space reducing loss function Random Forest put maximum importance hyperparameter optimization. basic mechanism make XGBoost faster weight calculated ratio square sum residual sum number residual regularization factor, whereas Ridge Regression, sum squared residual denominator. Therefore, case XGBoost, sum residual first neutralizes negative value reduces overall value residual. hand, squared value residual Ridge Regression always non-negative increase value residual Ridge Regression compared XGBoost.4.4 LimitationsFor XGBoost Random Forest capable fit small size tabular data, data size study smaller model train. expected larger data size, prediction accuracy increased. experimentation includes three extensive experimental works, e.g., fabrication, preparation final specimen EDM, finally tensile testing. Fabrication L-DED machine time-consuming expensive. Due time facility constraint due COVID 19, EDM facility available users. future work, experiment recommended perform improve performance accuracy model.DED process prone rough surface finish internal porosity [1, 31]. stress–strain curve obtained similar identical two specimens. variation tensile property possibly resulted due variation layer thickness [26], caused surface internal defect fabricated specimens. According Zheng et al. [32], internal defect observed 316 stainless steel specimen fabricated L-DED process defect divided mainly two kinds: gas porosity lack-of-fusion porosity. final specimen cut original one substrate EDM. final thickness preset 2 mm specimens, cutting process faced difficulty due defect specimens. Therefore, thickness could maintained constant 2 mm groups, manual surface finishing, final layer height ranged 0.79 1.83 mm average 1.51 mm. might caused coarser microstructure formed final layer due decrease cooling rate caused thermal accumulation increasing deposition height [33]. observed first two group higher energy density due lower scanning speed 8 mm/sec 9 mm/sec constant layer thickness closer 2 mm, deviation 2 mm variation layer height observed rest group well. concluded higher energy density mean lower scanning speed, fewer defect like entrapped gas porosity un-melted particle found specimen. minimum scanning speed, particle get time get melted. Therefore, surface get smoother mean le postprocessing le change overall quality part [34]. observed printing higher laser power, powder efficiency increased. Although higher powder efficiency responsible higher thickness original specimen, evident could control un-melted particle melt pool. Moreover, higher laser power cause decrease height stability multi-layered specimen [35], might caused decline tensile strength maximum laser power study.5 ConclusionDED popular choice aerospace, defense, biomedical, automotive industry decade.

Due varied laser power additive layer nature process, specimen experienced complex thermal cycle different location built. Thermal behavior add great deal prediction quality model. traversed molten pool formed finely focused laser beam cause higher cooling rate solidification. complex thermal behavior responsible microstructure complexity due consistency tensile property might suffered. Therefore, microstructure used one outcome along tensile property establish correlation among them. inconsistency tensile property different group also affected learning curve model training. Therefore, multicollinearity avoided data collection. improve model’s accuracy, different parameter considered along current one term F score find optimum combination parameter affecting results.

SLM, emerging additive manufacturing (AM) technology, receiving increasing attention due superior ability produce high-performance part complex geometry [3,4]. Nowadays, SLM widely used manufacturing various 316L SS parts. specialized applications, directionally solidified turbine blades, require anisotropic property along specific planes. However, anisotropic mechanical property might undesirable structural application [5]. order provide accurate reliable material performance data practical application guide optimization engineering design manufacturing processes, necessary conduct comprehensive study anisotropy mechanical behavior SLM 316L SS.In recent years, numerous study demonstrated laser additive manufacturing (LAM), strength sample perpendicular building direction higher sample parallel building direction [6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13]. order obtain comprehensive understanding anisotropic performance mechanical properties, researcher studied mechanical property 316L SS different direction different surfaces. V. Ajay et al.

Beibei et al. found anisotropy mechanical property XZ plane SLM Ti6Al4V specimen obvious XY plane [16]. Yupeng Ren et al. studied mechanical property cold-sprayed 7075 Al coating found mechanical anisotropy primarily existed deposition direction (Z) XY plane. tensile direction change X/Y direction Z direction, ultimate tensile strength gradually decrease [17]. A. Charmi et al. found yield strength specimen increased angle specimen sampling direction substrate decreased [18]. L. Palmeira Belotti et al. studied anisotropy stainless steel part fabricated thick-walled arc additive manufacturing, found uniaxial tensile loading conditions, material exhibited anisotropic mechanical response TDBD plane along transverse, 45° transverse (diagonal), BD direction [19]. L. Hitzler et al. found variation mechanical characteristic resulting altering inclination loading layer differed, demonstrated highly dependent material [20].In existing research, found different variation anisotropy plane perpendicular construction direction plane parallel construction direction technology.

IntroductionDissimilar metal weld joint austenitic stainless steel nickel alloy extensively utilized many medium high temperature application power, energy conversion systems, oil gas industry [1]. Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) better option joining austenitic stainless steel based weld joints. selection voltage current play important role gas tungsten arc welding dissimilar metal welds. Higher voltage may lead burn-through thin sheet lower voltage may lead lack fusion. Higher welding current increase heat input welding pool, causing increase depth width weld [2]. Mohammed et al. [3] analyzed austenitic duplex stainless steel-based welded joint using GTAW process. heat input required different two material considered study. Based experiment observed that, lower heat input joint shown better tensile properties. Gaffar et al.

Perez et al. [5] noticed satisfactory dissimilar welding mild steel stainless steel achieved GTAW metal inert gas (MIG) welding process better tensile strength achieved GTAW process. Post weld heat treatment considered method strengthening material used improve mechanical properties, enhancement strength, hardness, wear resistance, machinability, formability [6]. Tensile property fracture behavior stainless steel determined relevant microstructure function chemical composition applied heat treatment. effect heat treatment AISI 304 stainless steel joint investigated Nasir et al. [7]. tensile strength improved grain size reduction improved grain boundaries. Singh et al. [8] analyzed effect cryogenic treatment Ti-6Al-4V alloy stated hardness increased 2.5 HRC slight decrease compressive strength cryogenic treatment. Vengatesh et al.

Homogeneous crystal structure precipitation ultrafine carbide observed cryogenic treatment steels. cryogenic treatment capability improve mechanical property metals, unfortunately resulted reduced resistance corrosion. Deep cryogenic treatment dramatically improved wear resistance high temperature.Peng-Yan Sun et al. [10] used digital image correlation (DIC) method Ti based welded joints. strain distribution found heterogenous deformation side weld centerline found symmetrical. Although, study already reported austenitic stainless steel nickel alloys, study Monel 400 alloy SS 316L stainless steel limited analysis post weld treatment heat treatment cryogenic treatment tensile behavior Monel 400 SS 316L studied far. Since dissimilar weld joint SS 316L Monel 400 weld wider application petrochemical, oil, gas sectors, decided study effect post weld treatment gas tungsten arc welding.

IntroductionLaser-based powder bed fusion (LPBF), selective laser melting, one popular additive manufacturing technique fabrication metal alloy [1]. type additive manufacturing process, dense metal powder layer irradiated high energy laser (usually Nd: YAG fiber laser) fuse powder, cause metal temperature go high 105 °C rate cooling go high 108 °C/s inside melt pool (MP) [2]. characteristic MP significant effect mechanical property LPBF-processed specimens. reported solid grows epitaxially initial solidification around MP boundary [3]. heat transfer condition phenomenon determine final microstructure following initial solidification [3]. Depending energy transfer (laser power scan speed), solid metal formed result thermal gradient among MPs previously melted layers, lead formation texture columnar type grain as-built part [4]. laser spot move relatively fast (e.g., 0–1500 mm/s). result, metal powder melt solidify quickly, lead material solidification non-equilibrium condition retained residual thermal stress [5]. condition one main disadvantage additive manufacturing, particularly LPBF process, compared conventional manufacturing process casting forging. One main grade austenitic stainless steel 316 L low carbon amount (0.03 wt %) [6]. SS316L, rapid solidification cooling rate LPBF lead fine cellular structure fine sub-grains size hundred nanometers, significantly smaller size grain traditionally solidified SS316L [[7], [8], [9], [10]]. Based previous study [[11], [12], [13]], LPBF process achieves substantially higher ultimate tensile strength (UTS) strain breakage compared traditional methods.During melting process LPBF, final product effect various manufacturing conditions. condition significantly impact specimens' internal composition, including size shape grain distribution material elemental compositions. Heat treatment usually employed post-processing improve product quality. post-processing heat treatment enhance mechanical property part made LPBF process. post-processing heat treatment, specimen heated furnace predefined temperature set dwell time, followed cooling prescribed approach (e.g., quenching tempering). metal typically heated recrystallization temperature allowed cool room temperature [11]. heat treatment, mechanical performance steel largely depends number grain morphologies.Chen et al.

However, heat treatment ranging 1100 1200 °C eliminates σ phase. also found longer dwell time 1200 °C resulted grain coarsening transition columnar equiaxed grains. Nan et al.

Microwave heating material basically different conventional heating processes. Microwave interaction material depends upon dielectric property materials. energy conversion rather energy transfer conventional heating materials. Microwave energy delivered directly material molecular interaction result volumetric heating inside material. conventional heating, material surface high temperature core result poor microstructure inside core due high thermal gradient surface core.11–14 Consequently, component may lose intended design property upon heating conventional mode due overheating unintended areas. Applications microwave material processing also environment friendly.

AISI 316L SS become one widely used material metal additive manufacturing due excellent property wide application fields. Selective laser melting AISI 316L stainless steel (SLM AISI 316L SS) produce complex structure high-performance parts, broad industrial biomedical application prospects. process SLM AISI 316L SS, material undergoes complex change process, microstructure material molding different AISI 316L SS manufactured traditional technology (Ref 2,3,4,5).At present, mechanical property additive manufacturing (AM) material improved strengthening toughening. Sun et al. (Ref 6) refined grain size SLM AISI 316L SS 500 nm, obtained material yield strength close 900 MPa ultimate tensile strength 1250 MPa. Zhu et al. (Ref 7) studied three strengthening mechanisms, namely lattice friction stress, grain boundary strengthening dislocation strengthening, indicating strengthening mechanism additive manufacturing material grain boundary strengthening. Based strengthening mechanism directed energy deposited austenitic stainless steel, Smith et al. (Ref 8) quantitatively determined strengthening contribution high dislocation density material. yield strength AM-316L prepared AlMangour et al. reached 827.5 MPa, concluded combined effect grain boundary strengthening Orowan strengthening main strengthening (Ref 9, 10). Chen et al. (Ref 11) found strengthening mechanism SLM AISI 316L SS mainly included dislocation strengthening, grain boundary strengthening solid solution strengthening. Kong et al. (Ref 12) showed size cellular structure also certain influence strengthening, cellular structure hinder dislocation motion (Ref 13). Therefore, effect microstructure SLM AISI 316L SS strengthening need considered advanced research.Molten pool overlap typical microcosmic feature additive manufacturing materials. Molten pool overlap divided three types: intra-layer overlap, interlayer overlap mixed overlap (Ref 14). adjusting overlap rate molten pool (Ref 15), powder fused better manufacturing quality improved. simulation, Pan et al. (Ref 16) found interlayer overlap rate molten pool 48.84%, good compactness. high energy laser beam melt metal powder form molten pool, physical chemical reaction occur molten pool, partial remelting occurs solidified pool layer previous layer (Ref 17,18,19). Change process parameter affect size microstructure overlapping area (Ref 3, 20, 21). study show microstructure SLM AISI 316L SS refined adjusting scanning speed, power process parameter (Ref 22,23,24,25). Different overlap rate molten pool could lead change local temperature difference heat transfer condition molten pools, important influence shape size columnar grain (Ref 26,27,28) cellular structure (Ref 29, 30) additive manufacturing materials. mechanical property SLM AISI 316L SS also greatly improved adjusting microstructure columnar grain cellular structure (Ref 31,32,33,34). Chen et al. (Ref 35) calculated overlap rate molten pool different process parameter SLM AISI 316L SS, found overlap molten pool important influence dynamic mechanical properties. Therefore, great significance study effect molten pool overlap microstructure mechanical property SLM AISI 316L SS.In work, SLM AISI 316L SS specimen different volumetric energy density prepared SLM technology. Quasi static properties, dynamic mechanical property microstructure SLM AISI 316L SS tested. Influence overlapping pool microstructure discussed, relationship overlapping rate molten pool mechanical property investigated.2 Materials MethodsChemical composition AISI 316L SS powder used experiment shown Table 1.

(c) Microcrack 1400 s−1 strain rateFull size image4 DiscussionVolumetric energy density affect overlap rate molten pool (Ref 37, 38). increase volumetric energy density, overlap rate molten pool increases. work, volumetric energy density regulated controlling scanning power, adjusting hatch distance scanning speed. According Eq 1, hatch distance scanning speed decrease, volumetric energy density increases. Decrease hatch distance scanning spacing increase intra-layer overlap interlayer overlap. seen Fig. 5(c), scanning speed fast hatch distance large, intra-layer overlap less, interlayer overlap sufficient, resulting low-density area (Ref 39). area prone micro-cracks micro-holes, reduces performance material. changing printing strategy, reasonable overlap molten pool obtained mechanical property specimen improved (Ref 40, 41).Molten pool overlap affect size columnar grain cellular structure. seen Fig. 5(b), increase molten pool overlap, size columnar grain reach lowest value (14.91 μm) overlap rate 69.5%. Columnar grain size refined appropriate overlap molten pools. increase overlap rate molten pools, depth molten pool remelting zone could increase, temperature gradient decrease, conducive increase columnar grain size, resulting grain coarsening (Ref 31). seen Fig. 6(d), size cellular structure molten pool overlap area larger unoverlapped area. temperature gradient remelting area smaller, conducive growth cellular structure, overlap area larger cellular structure (Ref 42, 43). time, increase overlap molten pools, cooling rate decrease, conducive refinement microstructure, lead increase size cellular structure molten pool (Ref 44). Therefore, increase molten pool overlap, average size cellular structure specimen increase.According study, strengthening cellular structure (strengthening coefficient 180 MPa μm1/2) weaker traditional grain boundary (strengthening coefficient 250 MPa μm1/2) (Ref 45, 46), still satisfies Hall-Petch strengthening relationship. Kong et al. (Ref 44) found cellular structure le effective hindering dislocation movement traditional grain boundaries. According cellular structure size Fig. 7, assumed cellular structure size overlapped area four specimen 0.65 μm unoverlapped area 0.49 μm, cellular structure contribution specimen G-A 10 MPa higher specimen G-D. Therefore, strengthening SLM AISI 316L SS mainly provided cellular structure.Grain boundary strengthening calculated Hall-Petch relation, expressed follows (Ref 47):$$\sigma_{GB} = kd^{ - 1/2}$$ (3) k strengthening coefficient [assuming 540 MPa·μm1/2 (Ref 48)], average columnar grain size, substituted columnar grain size Fig. 5(b) counted Fig. 11. increase overlap rate molten pools, overlap rate molten pool reach 69.5%, grain boundary strengthening reach 139.90 MPa.Fig. 11Overlap rate molten pool grain boundary strengthening contribution SLM AISI 316L SS different volumetric energy densitiesFull size imageTherefore, increase molten pool overlap, contribution cellular structure strength decreases, reasonable overlap rate molten pool make melting fully. Meanwhile, columnar grain smallest grain boundary contribute strengthening, together determine strength material. increase molten pool overlap rate, contribution cellular structure strengthening decreases. However, reasonable molten pool overlap rate make full melting, columnar grain size smallest, grain boundary strengthening contribution largest. Therefore, reasonable molten pool overlap improve mechanical property SLM AISI 316L SS.5 ConclusionsIn work, effect molten pool overlap dynamic mechanical properties, quasi-static mechanical property microstructure SLM AISI 316L SS studied. main conclusion follows: (1) volumetric energy density molten pool overlap rate reach 138.89 J/mm3 69.5%, respectively, tensile strength, dynamic compressive strength impact energy SLM AISI 316L SS reach 495.81, 1195.78 MPa 125.33 MJ/m3.

However, additively manufactured component may still need additional machining meet specific requirements. aim, present work deal machining additively manufactured SS 316L four different cooling environments, namely dry, flood, minimum quantity lubrication (MQL), cryogenic carbon dioxide (CO2). tool wear, surface roughness, cutting temperature, hardness evaluated using various cooling methods. Additionally, residual stress explored help XRD data. result experiment show cryogenic CO2 performs well term cooling reduces friction tool work material, thereby reducing tool wear. cryogenic cooling, surface finish improved 43–46%, 33–36%, 15–17% dry, flood, MQL conditions, respectively.Previous article issueNext article issueKeywordsAdditive manufacturingMillingCryogenic coolingSustainability1. IntroductionStainless steel (SS) 316L material regularly used many engineering medical application outstanding resistance oxidation corrosion [1]. also posse strong mechanical property make suitable high-strength applications. medical field, used implant material since posse excellent biocompatibility [2]. general, conventionally produced stainless steel used several purposes, new method developed manufacturing intricate shape great precision [3]. Additive manufacturing (AM) used manufacture intricate shape biomedical application human implants. Even though method manufacture part complicated structures, surface part may fine quality, needing machining achieve requirement successful application [4].Selective Laser Melting (SLM) method used manufacture part laser fusion process used metal powder PH 17–4 Stainless steel, AISI 316L, Maraging steel, Ti-6Al-4V, etc [5]. SLM us powder bed fusion technique create part melting thin layer powder one layer time using focussed laser beam straight towards designed part [6]. SLM method, chamber used manufacturing filled inert gas (Argon) Gas(N2) curtail oxidation process surface powder. SLM method, creation nearly completely closely packed atom metal part physical attribute equivalent component created using traditional methods. SLM make possible produce manufactured part low porosity, high material utilization rates, high relative density even arbitrarily complicated architecture [7]. However, laser processing settings, chamber environment, powder bed preheating, particularly powder feedstock noteworthy influence quality SLM-generated parts. enhance geometrical microstructural characteristic produced workpiece example surface integrity, high density, residual stress, researcher mostly concentrated trying distinct process parameters. Getting adequate surface finish crucial challenge SLM method. Even though layer thickness (LT) decreased increase surface quality, desired surface characteristic may obtained [8]. So, necessary investigate whether machining process could designed enhance surface characteristic [9], [10].During conventional machining processes, high-temperatures cause tool wear damage machined face [11], [12]. According Krolcyzk et al., dry machining, potentially useful reducing number cleaning processes, drastically reduces machinability, degrades integrity machined face, shortens tool life induced cutting force temperature increase [13]. Dry machining lead friction adhesive action amid chip-tool work-tool junction thereby leading higher wear tool abridged tool life [14]. Since dry machining may lead negative characteristic work material high surface roughness,and also reduced tool life,different coolant technique used address problem [15], [16]. maximize machinability material, suitable cutting fluid (CFs) employed historically, mineral oil contain typically highly harmful chemical additive serve coolants, lubricating agent chip flow assistant [17]. Furthermore, usage conventional CFs becomes additional cost manufacturing process motor pumping coolant cutting region consume energy [18]. Safe disposal CFs necessary toxic nature [19]. Green sustainable manufacturing technique could employed shift usage coolant minimum level utilize eco-friendly coolant cryogenic Carbon dioxide (CO2) liquid nitrogen (LN2). [20]. Salur et al. [21] performed milling experiment using AISI 1040 steel workpiece dry Minimum Quantity Lubrication (MQL) environment achieve sustainable manufacturing [21]. MQL better flank wear seen compared coolant machining, ability clear debris machining area provide necessary cooling. According MQL's perspective, using little CF possible highly cost-effective since considerably minimizes lubrication expense [22], [23]. MQL technology, compared flood cooling, improves evaporative convective heat transfer, leading effective cooling. Micro milling SS 316 MQL condition show Built Edge (BUE) presence negative effect surface trait machined face [24]. Enhanced surface finish reduced cutting force observed MQL condition machining AISI 304 SS. Using le CF make machining sustainable one le impact health worker [25]. performing machining steel performance tool MQL enhanced parameter relation dry machining. higher speeds, oil layer amid tool’s face chip get distorted leading accelerated tool wear [26]. Da Silva et al. conducted comparison effect distinct machining condition dry flood strategy tool wear using cemented carbide tool milling AISI1047 steel. cutting zone received cooling/lubrication fluid via flood cooling, lowering flow rate coolant, MQL. result show employing lower flow rate system lead longer tool life. Furthermore, junction amid chip tool precludes happening cutting edge chipping cooling condition [27]. Dhar et al. [28] observed machining AISI 4340 MQL method,the flank wear lower flood dry machining. declining cutter wear attributed lessening heat flank side cutter. Due reduced heat tool-chip contact, clear correct application MQL approach may extend tool life [28]. Mia et al. [29] use olive oil green recyclable coolant MQL hardened steel workpiece analyzed performance based machined face texture heat cutting area. comparing olive oil MQL mode coolant methodologies, author conclude supplying coolant MQL mode better mode green manufacturing [29]. Jerold et al. [30] studied several cryogenic coolant found CO2 cause reduced flank wear cutting force compared LN2 [30]. Xiaobin et al. conducted high-speed milling experiment steel evaluated machining based parameter like flank wear, chip analysis, cutting force, heat machined zone, tool stress. result compared finite element model inferred temperature great impact tool life [31]. Masood et al. examined usage cryogenic coolant milling observed cryogenic coolant produced good surface finish sustainable cheaper machining cost [32]. flood cooling cryogenic cooling compared SUS 304 stainless steel,cryogenic cooling showed better performance even higher depth cut term crater wear surface quality, tool used conventional coolant developed micro crack tooltip [33]. Different cooling processes, including cryogenic, MQL, Flood dry cutting strategy employed machining 17–4 PH SS. several depth cut (DOC) cryogenic cooling better performance term decreased temperature cutting area, enhanced surface characterisitics, reduced crater wear. Additionally, thickness chip lower, method proved ecologically benign [34]. significant drop cutting temperatures, F. Klocke et al. noticed decreased flank wear good surface quality cryogenic machining compared MQL machining [35]. Hong et al. [36] analyzed several cooling method machining AISI 304 concluded cryogenic cooling performed better resulted higher profitability emulsion cooling, health environmental issues.In dry cutting conditions, work material often stick cutting tool, cause cutting tool lose optimal shape reduces surface smoothness. summary, one conclude cooling technique significant impact machining activity. study, novel sustainable approach different cooling technique studied respect additively manufactured components. additively manufactured SS316 specimen layer thickness (LT) 60 µm one orientation (0°) milled four distinct cooling environment (dry, flood, cryogenic, MQL) measure cutting temperature, tool wear, chip morphology, surface finish, microhardness ass role cutting strategies.

However, application involve joining metallic material extensive [1]. metallic materials, austenite stainless steel (SS) attracted great attention due excellent property like high strength, ductility, corrosion resistance. widely used manufacture surgical instrument many industrial scientific field like medical petrochemical industry [2, 3]. Among austenite SS, SS-316L used bone surgery due high anti-rust property attributed extra low carbon content it. steel (SS-316L) widely used many industrial field like cryogenic, nuclear, pharmaceutical photographic equipment, shipbuilding industry [3, 4]. Currently, several conventional advanced welding method available like tungsten inert gas welding (TIG), laser beam welding (LBW), electron beam welding (EBW), plasma arc welding butt joining SS-316L. process certain advantage disadvantage respect certain application [5]. LBW EBW highly efficient equipment cost significantly high [6, 7]. Therefore, need low-cost efficient welding process butt joining SS-316L.Recently, processing various type material (such ceramics, composites, polymer even metals) using microwave energy emerged novel environment-friendly technique [8]. Depending upon dielectric property materials, microwave penetrate inside metal provide energy interaction atomic level. Therefore, generation heat occurs throughout volume metal resulting uniform heating. inverse thermal gradient associated microwave heating resulted unique property processed materials. Microwave processing afford le processing time due volumetric heating characteristic provide product better property cannot achieved using conventional heating methods. Hence, adopted many industry [9]. Sharma et al. [10] first establish fusion joining two bulk metallic material employing hybrid microwave heating (MH) approach taking metal based powder filler.

Further, fabricated SS-316-based weldment using nano-based Ni powder exhibit high tensile strength (about 1.25 time micron powder based joint) [13]. effect input parameter (type base metal, size filler material, processing time) dissimilar joint (SS304/SS316) property (microhardness micro tensile strength) investigated Pal et al. [15]. author reported size filler material significant factor joint property among three parameter considered research work. Bagha et al. [16] also examined effect filler particle size mechanical characteristic SS304-SS304 weldment produced hybrid MH. author reported weldment fabricated small size powder filler layer exhibit better mechanical properties. Further, chemical composition filler material also play important role joint characteristic fabricated weldment. microwave butt joining SS-316 two filler material (Ni SS-316) reported literature [12, 17]. literature, found weldment fabricated SS-316-based filler material exhibit better joint property (physical mechanical) Ni-based counterparts. due better chemical similarity SS-316 based filler material SS-316 base metal compared Ni-based filler SS-316 base metal. Sahota et al. [18] reported butt joining ferrite stainless steel (SS-430) two filler (Ni SS-316L) comparative study made type fabricated weldment. author reported better mechanical property achieved weldment fabricated SS-316L filler. due relatively smaller size SS-316L-based powder used filler compared Ni-based powder, resulted enhanced microwave coupling. Moreover, SS-316L filler chemical composition better compatibility base metal (SS-430) joined compared Ni-based filler, resulted superior diffusion bonding interfacing surface joined. discussion, found chief way controlling fusion zone (FZ) composition mean filler metals. filler material similarity parent material composition resulted better mechanical properties. Further, study, deduced joining SS-316L base metal reported form using microwave energy. Therefore, current study, possibility butt joining SS-316L SS-316L powder interlayer investigated obtain high-strength joint using hybrid MH approach. weldment processed microwave energy characterized term phase detection, microstructure/elemental analysis, measurement tensile flexural properties.2 Experimental2.1 Material DetailsThe specimen appropriate dimension (25 × 10 × 3 mm3) cut using wire cut machine (make: Elektra; model no: ELCUT234). 99% pure extra low carbon containing SS-316L powder (make: Intelligent Material Pvt.

Keywords: wire arc additive manufacturing; SS 316L; mild steel; microstructure; additive manufacturing 1. IntroductionResearch additive manufacturing (AM) technology various possibility increased last decade. application developed studying sample part made single material. benefit enormous, demonstrating potential technology replace traditional subtractive manufacturing technologies. Currently, research carried looking possibility combining different material manufacture single part. Bimetallic structure (BMSs) applied two different zone present specific property requirements. help maximize performance every area component. BMSs combine metal steels, nickel-based materials, aluminum titanium, find application aerospace, naval automotive industries. expensive high-performance alloy need employed, BMSs allow u reduce cost part using material specific location needed [1,2]. Serving purpose, wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) provides acceptable results, achieves higher material deposition rates, making productive and, therefore, cost-effective. Another peculiarity technology applicability weldable metals, thus allowing use wide range material reduced cost [3].Bimetallic structure made different material combinations. suitable couple material must chosen order avoid defects. effect, chemical physical property must considered, cannot always corrected adjusting process parameters. Different Coefficients Thermal Expansion (CTEs) lead stresses, especially cooling thermal treatment applied, different contraction behavior. Chemical incompatibility material used lead formation brittle unstable interface matrix [4]. migration element (including Fe, Cr, Ni, Mn, W, Mo Nb) one region another determine property joining final part. appearance compound determines formation secondary phase [5,6]. dispersion element two alloy depicted. hardness microstructure region, well variation interface, also studied.Hereafter, common material combination benefit mentioned. Copper–stainless steel (SS) combine high conductivity copper high corrosion resistance stainless steel. main application fusion reactors, heat exchanger cookware [7]. high corrosion resistance aluminum make aluminum–steel bimetallic part employed adapter oxygen regenerators detail equipment electrolytic refining [8]. High-quality Nickel–Steel combination difficult obtain due different material properties.

Therefore, worth mentioning choice appropriate process take consideration initial state materials, interaction process parameter final product property [4, 5].Any preliminary chosen process requires mastering three processing step summarized [11]: CAD model: includes slicing scanning algorithms; shape, dimensions, geometry final product define complexity future product. consequence, processing time quality highly depend resulting scanning parameter generated processing algorithm; processed material: class material (metal, ceramic polymer), nature (powder, filament liquid), related property allow defining adequate process could produce suitable products; energy source: interaction based material heat source important issue taken account. many heat source used induction heat, lasers, electrical arc, UV source. ISO/ASTM 52.900 standard depict useful classification based material class, material nature, energy physic processing laser beam powder bed fusion metal (PBF-LB/M) polymer (PBF-LB/P), electron beam powder bed fusion metal (PBF-EB/M), Material Extrusion-based (MEx). Related standards, process classified seven main category depicted Fig. 1.Fig. 1Main category technologiesFull size imageIn consequence, processed material, technology selected, type energy source directly affect property final product also condition production rate post-processing operation [11]; latter optimized according input parameter based multi objective perspective.The selective laser melting (SLM) technology one process belongs PBF-LB/M processing class feeding material powder. SLM technology, thin bed powder spread substrate plate. Then, Nd-YAG laser beam irradiates powder bed according predefined processing parameter [12] showing Fig. 2. Briefly, process parameter grouped follows: Scanning parameters: trajectory, hatch space, pattern orientation. Laser parameters: beam radius, power scanning speed. Fig. 2Basic principal SLM process [44]Full size imageIn general, PBF-LB/M SLM, material state processed go two major phases; melting solidification. Thus, final physical property SLM part vary due unique processing conditions, specifically rapid cooling (107 °C/s) [13,14,15]. Rapid cooling rate may lead non-equilibrium state could generate high residual stresses, amorphous region even thin cracks. Unmolten powder due existence high melting point created oxide inappropriate processing condition may appear. Porosity also induced metal vaporization powder denudation [16]. Nevertheless, re-melting occurs, solidification defect locally avoided re-melted regions. Many researcher engineer pointed necessity take consideration extra thickness top surface product re-melting phenomenon ensured final printed layer avoid casting defect region [17].Simmons et al. [1] shown unique thermal profile SLM change microstructure compared traditionally processed material alters thermal conductivity locally additively manufactured 316 L stainless steel (SS). processing condition employ lower energy density optimum, bulk thermal conductivity theoretical effective medium thermal conductivity prediction much 10%.Liu et al. [18] showed subsequent thermal cycling (STC), unique thermal behavior multi-layer manufacturing process selective laser melting (SLM), significant influence thermal behavior SLM process thus affect microstructure SLM-made parts. Although, laser irradiates layer, neighborly underlying layer re-melted thoroughly form perfect bonding neighbor layers, excellent mechanical property achieved solidification.Moreover, Gong [13] observed change ultimate tensile strength 1237 978 MPa Ti-6Al-4V specimen produced SLM changing laser power scanning speed. addition, previous work tried correlate mechanical property grain size recrystallization feature [19,20,21]. now, SLM-316L produce fine dendritic structure, scale 1 µm, grow parallel separate colonies. crystallization type also showed locally energy dependence within melt pool. Higher energy density cause recrystallization previous layer, lower energy density may [19,20,21].Nowadays, LPBF processes, theory solidification allows predicting final microstructure mean existing theoretical background [22, 23]. Actually, theory involves complex interplay many physical effect implemented simulation program using technique phase-field method coupled cellular automaton computing techniques; mixture technique last decade evolved and, allows predicting phenomenon [24, 25]: nucleation new grain according thermodynamic equilibrium multiphase interphase; dendritic growth based orientation columnar equiaxed shape nucleated grains; neighbor area surrounding molten pool region affected series intrinsic heat treatment due conduction phenomenon thermal power continuously fed bulk material via successive laser irradiations. Thus, several researcher conducted many study predict microstructural evolution within LBP-LB/M material employing analytical numerical simulation [22, 23, 26].Moreover, noticeable microstructure analysis hardness tests, metal reveal essential mechanical properties. Therefore, preliminary study first post-processing metallurgical observation therefore crucial study material design formulation [46].In study, laser powder bed fusion process (SLM) described. SS316L sample elaborated laser powder bed fusion process (SLM). Scanning speed laser power varied sample additively manufactured. as-built heat treated sample investigated scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XR-F), EDS spectrum, surface Vickers hardness (top side face samples), metallurgical observation, porosity analysis well. effect series annealing property as-build sample discussed based characteristic laser (power scanning speed) volumetric energy density. Results showed different mechanical surface property depend laser scanning direction VED.Furthermore, work try point important hardness variation according printed samples’ side processing parameters. result also allow detecting VED energy threshold densification material take place upon intrinsic annealing enforced laser irradiation heat flux. Moreover, statistical procedure Sect. 3.2.2 developed author catch much hardness homogenization samples’ surface evolves HT temperature levels. addition, paper present simple image processing procedure measurement porosity basis microscopy. algorithm developed author MATLAB platform detailed Appendix.2 Materials methods2.1 Material 316LActually, limited range material produced PBF-LB/M process SLM alike; includes titanium Ti-based alloy [47,48,49], AZ31 magnesium-based alloy [50], Al2O3/GdAlO3/ZrO2 [51,52,53], aluminum alloy [54], tool steel [55]. study, proposed investigate hardness evolution SS316L produced SLM. SS316L austenitic chromium-nickel-based stainless steel known high corrosion resistance [21].Zhang et al. [56] studied effect Ni content stainless steel laser melting deposition. author stated decrease micro-hardness value addition Ni could due phase transition ferrite phase austenite phase since Ni austenite-promoter chemical element. increase Ni content, wear resistance as-deposited specimen decreased gradually, attributed fact wear resistance proportional micro-hardness following Archard's law [57]. However, corrosion resistance significantly improved increase Ni content well improvement electrochemical performance [56].The industrial 300 series stainless steel like 304L 316 considered austenitic metal [58]. Nevertheless, melting/solidification cycle cause instable residual ferrite austenite according cooling rate (local) ferrite number FN induce remaining quantity residual ferrite [59, 60]. Indeed, presence ferrite-promoter compound (M) chromium (Cr) cause segregation solidification also preferential site M23C6 carbide precipitation \(\sigma\)-phase [61] could increase embrittlement risk stainless steel [62].According above, main distinguished problem occur SS316L-SLM processing could summarized [59]: locally desired phase balance ferrite austenite Sensitization phenomenon along grain boundary producing intermetallic compound incorporating impurity element intergranular attack (IGA) intergranular stress corrosion (IGSC) could affect mostly Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) stainless steels; investigation, 316L powder utilized elaborate samples. powder particle quasi-spherical shown Fig. 3a.

Contrariwise, concerning SS316L SLM-made materials, WRC-1992 diagram estimate FN equal 10 DeLong diagram give FN around 15. mean DeLong diagram estimate higher percentage ferrite WRC-1992 diagram. remark quite logical since ferrite contribution silicone (Si) taken DeLong formula unlike WRC-1992. Hence since given amount silicone detectable X-RF analysis, remarkable result DeLong diagram seem accurate conclusion deduced WRC-1992 diagram.The decrease FN numerically explained decrease amount ferrite-promoter chemical element Cr decrease 17.74 17.4%, Mo fall 2.94 2.68%. decrease element caused following phenomenon: Concerning chromium [80] Formation chromium oxide (Fe,Cr2)O3 higher temperature material sensitive oxidation; Formation chromium carbide Concerning molybdenum [59] Formation molybdenum carbide Transformation instable ferrite stable austenite powder melting/solidification (or re-melting/solidification) thermal cycle enforcer heating (laser shots) cooling (convection bulk material) cycle occur building material. Furthermore, precipitation sequence morphology ferrite vary depending alloy element cooling rate [82]. solidification mode divided four type according value ratio Creq/Nieq [82]: F mode: \(L\to L+\delta \to \delta \to \delta +\gamma\) \({\mathrm{Cr}}_{\mathrm{eq}}/{\mathrm{Ni}}_{\mathrm{eq}}>2\) FA mode: \(L\to L+\delta \to L+\delta +\gamma \to \delta +\gamma \to \gamma\) \(1.5<{\mathrm{Cr}}_{\mathrm{eq}}/{\mathrm{Ni}}_{\mathrm{eq}}<2\) AF mode: \(L\to L+\gamma \to L+\delta +\gamma \to \gamma +\delta \to \gamma\) \(1.37<{\mathrm{Cr}}_{\mathrm{eq}}/{\mathrm{Ni}}_{\mathrm{eq}}<1.5\) mode: \(L\to L+\gamma \to \gamma\) \({\mathrm{Cr}}_{\mathrm{eq}}/{\mathrm{Ni}}_{\mathrm{eq}}<1.37\) F refer austenite ferrite, respectively; \(\gamma\) \(\delta\) refer austenite ferrite, respectively.Hammar et Stevenson (1979) proposed accurate formulation Creq Nieq (Eqs. 6 7) take account ferrite-promoter element Nb Ti. Moreover, Mo multiplied 1.37 highlight ferritic contribution element [83]:$${\mathrm{Cr}}_{\mathrm{eq}}=\mathrm{Cr}+1.37\mathrm{ Mo}+1.5\mathrm{ Si}+2\mathrm{ Nb}+3\mathrm{ Ti}$$ (6) $${\mathrm{Ni}}_{\mathrm{eq}}=\mathrm{Ni}+22\mathrm{ C}+14.2\mathrm{ N}+0.31\mathrm{ Mn}+\mathrm{Cu}.$$ (7) Thus, according Eqs. 6 7, Creq/Nieq ratio estimated equal 1.86 raw material 1.83 SLM-made material. discussed above, ferrite contribution also decrease Creq/Nieq ratio computed Hammar et Stevenson equations.Hence, according Creq/Nieq reported paper, worth mentioning 1.5 < Creq/Nieq < 2, mean solidification raw as-built material fall FA mode. result indicates ferrite \(\delta\) first precipitate solid state, three-phase reaction (\(L+\delta +\gamma\)) come limit solidus materials; finally reaction \((\delta +\gamma \to \gamma )\) continues solidus temperature. Nevertheless, FA mode shift AF mode cooling rate higher 100 °C/s proved experimentally [82]. might avoided SLM process since re-melting additional heating exist according series laser shot top processed materials, additional heating continuously fed printed bulk material. conditions, instable \(\updelta\)-ferrite decrease favor stable \(\upgamma\)-austenite express current evolution ferrite number.3.2 Hardness analysisThis section display result hardness test SLM SS316L as-built annealed samples. study conducted analyze effect processing parameter term laser power, scanning speed, also annealing temperatures.3.2.1 Hardness as-built materialsProcessing parameter hardness testing condition presented Sect. 2.3. hardness as-built material measured lateral top surface respectively denoted (HV_FS) (HV_FT). corresponding value reported Table 7 corresponding VED values.Table 7 HV_FS HV_FT value SLM-SS316L as-built materialsFull size tableThe surface response HV_FS HV_FT respectively depicted Fig. 9a, b. Moreover, hardness value plotted according VED energy exhibited Fig. 10a, b; polynomial model adopted surface curve fitting. MATLAB software adopted computing surface response regressive model used herein (Table 8).Fig. 9Surface response as-built SLM SS 316 L HV hardness versus scanning power speed side face b top faceFull size imageFig. 10HV hardness versus VED energy case as-built SLM SS 316 L lateral surface b top surfaceFull size imageTable 8 HV_FS HV_FT modeling versus process parameter VED energyFull size tableTable 9 report related model response surface fitting curve fitting correspond Figs. 9 10. Thus, based model 1 2 Table 9, first order decrease hardness according scanning speed V salient laser, effect quadratic lead quadratic effect VED energy described model 3 4 data (Table 9). Similar effect laser power VED energy explained proved additionally mean relationship shown presented Eq. 1.Table 9 HV_FS HV_FT evolution as-built state heat treated stateFull size tableThe fitting model significant since R2 R2_adjusted higher 80%. According models, HV_FS HV_FT assumed quadratic term laser power P linear according speed V. Moreover, model 1 2, contribution interaction term a4 related P.V quadratic term a3 (related P2) low compared contribution first order term a2 (related V) a1 (related P) least 300 times. allows interpreting model linearly dependent “P” “V” showing laser power increase HV scan speed decrease significant comparable coefficient \({a}_{i}\). modeling order variable P V quite reasonable since two level considered scanning speed V 3 level adopted laser power P. Based this, necessary increase number laser power scanning speed level detect wider behavior hardness property.Concerning effect VED energy according Fig. 10a, b, HV_FS HV_FT evolve increasingly starting first VED value around 55 J mm−3 critical value 166.67 J mm−3; hardness start fall higher VED energy. profile interpreted increase energy providing enhanced material density increased related hardness. Then, additional amount energy, higher \(166.67\mathrm{ J m}{\mathrm{m}}^{-3}\), assumed extending duration thermal cycle, leading intrinsic process annealing restructuration in-process constraints-relaxation. Hence, assumed in-process heat treatment decrease value measured hardness as-build samples. Furthermore, “HV vs. VED” profile Fig. 10 concord perfectly behavior [84] showing increase hardness, reaching maximum value, decrease higher VED levels.Moreover, Fig. 11 exhibit HV_FT HV_FS VED energy density. show top surface harder lateral surface. contrast might understood based cooling rate melted materials; lateral surface heat provided scanning laser irradiation top; energy diffused bulk material machine-plate temperature fixed 90 °C. heat flux increase instantly heat diffusion within core parts; lateral surface undergoes phenomenon.Fig. 11Hardness HV_FS HV_FT Versus VED energyFull size imageConcerning top surface, corresponding cooling rate likely higher since surface exposed processing chamber heated undergoes ambient temperature argon gas serf laser material melting pool fusion protection. addition, bulk processed material top surface constitute important enforced conductive heat flux could lead higher cooling rate compared lateral surfaces.3.2.2 Effect heat treatmentHeat treatment SLM as-built sample carried out. heat temperature presented Materials Methods section fixed temperature holding time.Figure 12a–d display HV measurement corresponding FS FT surface 600 °C 800 °C annealing temperatures. Table 9 exhibit corresponding measurement. According results, worth noting hardness heat treated material decrease heat treatment sample reported “HV Evolution” column Table 9.Fig. 12(HV_FS, HV_FT) VS VED energy as-built heat treated processed material FS face; = 600 °C b FT face; = 600 °C c FS face = 800 °C FT face = 800 °CFull size imageConcerning behavior annealed parts, corresponding hardness follow global behavior as-built part showing first increase final decrease reaching critical VED value.According Table 9, significant evolution hardness summarized following points: annealed sample 800 °C showed important decrease hardness compared sample treated 600 °C. mainly due level softening ensured effect heat treatment; higher temperature set holding time, important decrease hardness is; Concerning sample treated 600 °C, relaxation process important FT face (− 11.32%) FS face (− 8.46%), relative difference variation around 33,80% (computed by: \(\left| {\frac{{ - 11.36 - \left( { - 8.46} \right)}}{ - 8.46}} \right| = 33.80\%\)); Contrariwise, inverse sample treated 800 °C; say, hardness FS face decreased FT face; relative difference variation estimated around 15.25% (computed by: \(\left| {\frac{{ - 12.92 - \left( { - 11.21} \right)}}{ - 11.21}} \right| = 15.25\%\)); Except general decreasing behavior hardness according annealing temperature, remarkable hardness homogeneity take place 800 °C sample contrary 600 °C annealed samples. Indeed, relative difference hardness decrease 800 °C sample reached 15% compared 600 °C sample relative decrease difference around 33.80%. Hence, worth assuming processed matter homogeneous higher annealing temperatures; remark given maintaining time. result concordance metallurgy interpretation metallic material general regarding grain growth theory [85].Figure 13 show density probability hardness evolution sample differentiating two groups, annealed sample 600 °C 800 °C.

Moreover, hardness evolution 800 °C sample centered -12% concentrated compared hardness evolution profile 600 °C annealed samples; latter centered -10%, dispersed; mean that, heating maintain duration 15 min, 800 °C sample relaxed 600 °C.Fig. 13Density distribution annealed sample 600 °C 800 °CFull size imageThese remark supported grain growth theory grain size evolves direction heating holding time operation temperature [86, 87]. Thus, annealing 800 °C may increase grain size annealing 600 °C, since maintaining time operations. another hand, hardness evolves inverse proportion grain size lower value 800 °C annealed sample hardness compared 600 °C annealed sample explained according Hall–Petch relationship [88].3.3 Microscopy pores/cavities analysis3.3.1 As-built material microscopyTable 10 exhibit microscopy as-built sample organized scanning speed laser power. regard figures, observable cavity porosity intense lower power value (100 W) higher scanning speed value (300 mm/s); level corresponds low VED energy clearly highlighted figure a, c d. addition, unmolten region pointed SEM microscopy clearly observed Fig. 14. figure firmly confirms existence area material produced higher scan speed lower power (low value VED). figure display surface cavity spherical unmolten particle.Table 10 As-built material micrographsFull size tableFig. 14SEM micrograph as-built material region case sample (P1,V1)Full size imageFurthermore, heat flux direction highlighted blue arrow figure (g) (h) Table 10. figures, heat flux corresponds (\(- \vec{z}\)) direction since scan laser shot top surface (high temperature) bottom surface (low temperature). observation showed FT surface present porosity cavity FS surfaces; argued fact processing phase liquid metal flow gravity FT faces, flow melted material remains quite stable horizontal face FS face.The porosity percentage computed based image processing procedure programmed using MATLAB code detailed Appendix 1. estimated porosity level according corresponding VED energy as-built material plotted Fig. 15a, b. figures, noticeable porosity show rude decrease according VED energy faces. addition, observed numerically computed porosity FT surface higher FS surface; porosity FT face estimated approximately 10 time higher FS face. latter remark highlighted previous paragraph according graphical observation figure exhibited Table 8. According Eq. 1, VED energy increase Laser power decrease scan speed. behavior observed figure (a) (b) Fig. 15 porosity exponentially decreasing according VED values. Furthermore, black arrow Fig. 15a, b correspond highest scan speed value (300 mm/s) showing speed affect highly porosity laser power; rough decrease denoted VED value lead lack fusion powder induce presence numerous pores.Fig. 15Percentage porosity vs. VED as-built materialsFull size image3.3.2 Heat treated material microscopy analysisThe observation effect heat treatment microstructures challenging step detect using optical microscopy. why, paper, author inserted main interesting metallographic picture detected heat treatment. Figure 16 displayed metallographic picture corresponding FT face sample S5 (Fig. 16a) S17 (Fig. 16b). sample annealed 800 °C air-cooled.Fig. 16Top surface microstructures obtained heat treatment sample (a) S5 (b) S17Full size imageThe rapid cooling produce greater nucleation new crystals, way dendrite resulted small size; lower cooling rate led larger dendrites. shape related rapid growth crystal energetically favorable crystallographic direction strongly affect property material. phenomenon occurs presence multimodal alloy cooled temperature much lower solidification point.Figures 16a 15b present biphasic microstructures; matrix austenite dispersion branch microstructures Fig. 16a denoted heat treatment epitaxial columnar gain growth observed set islet Fig. 16b heat treatment.This change observed microstructures interpreted natural effect high temperature HT (800 °C) resulting likely globalization annealing. Hence, apparent hardness homogeneous HT microstructure quasi-spherical; observation supported conclusive remark Sect. 3.2.2.These two dispersions, uniaxial columnar microstructures, developed annealing instable ferrite \(\delta\) exists structure time austenite \(\gamma\) according analysis Sect. 3.1. Concerning evolution porosity, noticeable evolve significantly as-made annealed state additional porosity analysis provided present study.3.4 Results discussion density relationshipGeneral speaking, last sections, observed porosity hardness evolve input parameters; relationship hardness significant processing parameter highlighted using response surface methodology corresponding coefficient analyzed according corresponding evolution; porosity, also remarkable decrease VED energy, increasing according scan speed decreasing laser power values.These result supported experimental existing works; indeed, Salarian et al. stated number pore decrease increase laser power [89]. Similar result found cited Asgari et al. [90], du Plessis et al. [91]. Moreover, apart laser power effect, Song et al. [92] Shin et al. [93] linked also decrease porosity scan speed decrease. researcher presented analogous result Cherry et al. [94], Kamariah et al. [95], Sistiaga et al. [96].Hence, one conclude porosity decrease according global evolution VED energy; observation supported Song et al. [92], Bai et al. [97] Sun et al. [98] especially involved relationship processed matter’s density value porosity levels. sum, relative density increase volume fraction decrease laser power VED energy [89, 92, 97, 98].Furthermore, shape pore discussed Salarian et al. term pore irregularity sphericity pore increase laser power, contrariwise, aspect ratio decrease lower value laser power [89], express accelerated coalescence pores’ growth [90, 91]. perspective, Shin et al. included graphical analysis similar Table 10 present paper, shape size pore present irregular shape important size low laser power value higher scan speed levels.On another hand, Wang et al. proposed integrated simulation approach understanding mechanism pore key-holes formation metal additive manufacturing; investigation included multiphysics analysis regarding thermal-fluid flow model involving heat transfer, liquid flow, metal evaporation, Marangoni effect, Darcy’s law simulate keyhole pore formation process, simulation validated situ X-ray images. According simulations, author found pore sphericity reached higher level laser power low value scan speed [99]. Le et al., adopted thermo-fluid based simulation pointed similar result [100]. two paper included also role gas entrapment formation internal pores.Hence, based Table 10 paper, remark exactly pronounced regard resulting microscopy. consequence, author would like point evolution pore size shape power levels, since evolve vermicular likely elliptic shape likely spherical form increasing laser power, pore swollen higher value scan speed compared lowest value.Concerning hardness evolution according processing parameters, author attested built experimental relationship hardness density processing materials. Indeed, higher VED energy, denser produced material leading hardness increase [89, 92, 97, 98]; heat annealing heat treatment result softening material since grain size increase [92, 93]. result found present work. another hand, author paper would like point softening took place higher value VED assigned herein intrinsic annealing took place especially regarding side face (FS) highlighted Sect. 3.2.1.To support previous discussion, multivariate effect chart regarding hardness porosity plotted presented Fig. 17a, d. Hence, chart support discussion prove salient effect power scan speed porosity surface hardness value produced samples. numerical value surface response models’ coefficient Table 8 total concordance regard salient effect processing parameter Fig. 17a, b. Concerning Fig. 17c, d, multivariate effect chart show clearly porosity decrease laser power better analysis latter better support regard VED energy instead separate input parameter analysis; point literally detailed paragraph Sect. 3.3.1.Fig. 17Multivariate effect chart hardness porosityFull size imageThe density produced sample measured; Fig. 18a display density multivariate effect chart as-built samples’ density regard laser power scan speed. According Fig. 18a, one observe laser power cause increasing matter density, scan speed involves decrease. figure describes fact discussed earlier. Nevertheless, important change density denoted sample heat-treated; due reduced time heat-treatment adopted work probably sufficient mesoscale kinetics causing density changes. also due pressure condition according hydro isostatic pressure (HIP) heat treatment adapted modification microstructure, density treated material, mechanical property [101,102,103,104].Fig. 18a Multivariate effect regarding density b HV_FT VS density c HV_FS VS densityFull size imageThe change density directly affect hardness samples. Thus, 2D plot hardness HT sample according corresponding density carried depicted Fig. 18b, c. noticeable likely relationship derived plot hardness heat treated sample density; nevertheless, author could figure exactly nature behavior; additional trial accurate density measurement adopted pronounce reliable statement regard.4 ConclusionIn work, mechanical morphological investigation SS316L SLM-made sample carried term surface hardness characterization, corresponding heat treatment effect hardness, porosity assessment fabricated samples. hardness measured top side surface cubic sample annealing. effect SLM processing parameter material hardness microstructure investigated following conclusion drawn: Regarding chemical analysis: According XRF results, SLM process affect chemical composition raw material manufactured samples. solidification mode melting re-melting/cooling cycle assumed FA mode.

Various technique utilized 3D printing metals, Directed Energy Deposition, Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF), Electron Beam Powder Bed Fusion (EB-PBF), Binder Jetting [14]–​[17]. study, Selective Laser Melting (SLM) employed. SLM type powder bed fusion additive manufacturing technique widely used create solid object complex shape special feature layer layer melting metal powder laser beam [18], [19]. Fig. 1 show schematic illustration selective laser melting process [20]. FIGURE 1. Selective laser melting process [20].Show AllAlthough SLM provides unique capability additive manufacturing metal products, quality component produced technology hinders widespread application industrial sectors. Laser material parameters, including thickness layers, laser power, laser speed, scanning strategy, hatch distance, beam diameter, significantly affect physical mechanical property metal part fabricated SLM process [21], [22]. Energy density determinative factor selective laser melting process, solely specify shape melt pool property produced part. example, porosity built part occur high low energy density depending factor [22]. high energy density result keyhole pore balling effect due overheating, leading irregular track geometric surface changes. hand, low volumetric energy density insufficient melt solidify powder [22]. volume-based energy density E (J/mm3) defined Eq. 1, P laser power (W), v scan speed (mm/s), h hatch spacing (mm) layer thickness (mm) [23], [24]:E=Pv.h.d(1) View Source\begin{equation*} E=\frac {\mathrm {P}}{\mathrm {v.h.d}}\tag{1}\end{equation*} Laser power scan speed also crucial role geometric shape melt pool. Hatch distance great impact strength densification SLM-built parts. Moreover, spot size critical laser melting process. decreasing spot size, power density increase, absorption level changes. maximum penetration, focal point located within workpiece certain depth diameter. addition, laser scan strategy affect thermal gradient, ultimately microstructure mechanical property SLM-built parts. Scanning strategy play remarkable role formation defect balling effect high residual stress [25].

Porosity varies various parameter scanning speed, laser power, hatch distance, scan strategy [49], [50]. Loss overlap track cause higher porosity. laser power constant, smaller hatch distance nullifies effect scan speed creating pores. shown Fig. 4, overlap cube 3 four time inferior cube 2. Moreover, cube 2, narrower line formed melting region due lower laser power. Due high cooling rate SLM process, fine structure generated. thermal gradient lead thin structure melt pool. Enhanced hardness result various factor related refined structure.In research, one crucial point consider temperature change heat flow process. temperature process affect solidification morphology tracks. solidification SLM process, temperature gradient (G) influence neighboring solid interface. temperature gradient growth rate (R) critical role microstructure solidification morphology. changing scanning speed angle interaction laser beam scan track growth direction solidified material, growth rate modified [51]. Decreasing growth rate constant temperature gradient lead fixed, stable planar consolidation front; however, increasing growth rate result cellular formation dendrite solidification morphology [52]. cooling rate obtained multiplying G× R, describes relationship product microstructure quality, sense higher value cause finer microstructure. hand, high ratio G/R mean planar stability front crystallization; hence, low ratio G/R make instability. Moreover, orientation amount thermal gradient affect neighboring scan track melt pool. Therefore, solidification result vary depending change G R [52].B.

Scanning speed hatch spacing significantly influence porosity SLM-built parts. porosity increases, hardness, tensile strength, yield strength part decrease [53]. hatch distance scanning speed increased, hardness decreased. Moreover, density final part affected hatch spacing, scanning speed, laser power. Densification considerably reduced due insufficient melting powder presence pore caused improper setting hatch distance, scanning speed laser power [53], [54]. Porosities result initiation cracks, low relative densities, consequently lower hardness components.

IntroductionEngineers commonly use 316L stainless steel (SS) structural material due exceptional functional qualities. quality include good formability, excellent mechanical strength, weldability, corrosion resistance, oxidation resistance [1,2]. Applications 316L SS common nuclear, medical, petrochemical industry [3,4]. conventional manufacturing process 316L stainless steel (SS) consume exorbitant amount time money, particularly fabricating component complex structure undergone extrusion, forging, casting. One effective approach used fabricate 316L SS includes selective laser melting (SLM) due high process flexibility, high material utilization, short production time [5]. SLM additive manufacturing (AM) rapid prototyping process us metallic powder [6,7]. process, metal powders, together high-energy source, used fabricate complex design shapes. SLM used manufacture complex metallic part use 3-D printing computer-aided design [8], [9], [10]. compared conventional techniques, SLM processing typically requires post-processes mechanical tooling, and, therefore, exhibit high flexibility [11,12]. technology enables broad spectrum possibility constructing SLM part various application aerospace, medical [13], nuclear [14], automobile [15], rail industry [16]. Several study examined SLM process using metallic alloy tool steel [17], nickel alloy [18], NiTi alloy [19,20], Ti alloys, cobalt-based alloy [21], [22], [23], aluminum alloy [24].SLM widely examined effect processing parameter exert microstructure 316L SS, particularly effect porosity, unmelted powder, residual cracks, fatigue, thermal stress, surface roughness [25], [26], [27]. optimized process parameter generally result enhanced mechanical properties. Li et al. [28] suggested high laser power, low scan speed, narrow hatch spacing, thin layer thickness yield much smoother melting surface high densification 316L SS SLM process. hardness, Young's modulus, ultimate tensile strength 316L SS significantly influenced powder size, scanning strategy, scanning speed, laser power, hatch distance [29,30].SLM used fabricate highly complex metallic part without need conventional forming process due advantage near net shape manufacturing. formability improvement metallic part fabricated SLM one important aspect covered literature. Several study reported influence various process parameter exert formability uniaxial tension testing 316L SS fabricated SLM [31], [32], [33]. Wilson-Heid et al. [34] investigated effect initial pore tensile behavior 316L stainless steel. discovered ultimate tensile strength lifetime durability affected pore size. Ronneberg et al. [35] analyzed relationship porosity, microstructure, mechanical behavior 316L SS fabricated laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). found shape, size, orientation, distribution pore crucial parameter affecting mechanical behaviors. microstructural feature also influence deformation failure behavior metallic part fabricated SLM. Kale et al. [7] discussed microstructural feature crystallographic orientation, initial dislocation density, precipitates, cellular walls, GBs important aspect affect deformation fracture behavior 316L SS fabricated SLM. Many factor melt pool boundaries, unmelted particles, porosity contribute crack initiation component plastic deformation [35,36]. numerically challenging adequately discus aspect affect crack initiation propagation; hence, factor given individual attention. Moreover, failure behavior material mainly dictated porosity [35]. Therefore, important understand impact pore failure behavior material different loading conditions. recent study discussed effect surface subsurface porosity fatigue behavior SLM material [37], [38], [39]. study employed FE analysis quantify effect shape, size distribution pore exert fatigue behavior SLM material concluded dimensional parameter location pore largely affect stress concentration factor vicinity.The V-bending process typical method used evaluate formability sheet metals. improved work-hardening rate advanced high-strength steel delay crack nucleation material manages uniform strain distribution bent surface [40]. Kaupper et al. [41] performed optical strain measurement identify initiation propagation crack advanced high-strength steel bending tests. nucleation crack evolves formation shear band material. Kaijalainen et al. [42] bended ultrahigh-strength strip steel investigate possibility strain localization narrow shear band could primary cause crack nucleation bending process. Saastamoinen et al. [43] indicated bendability direct-quenched strip steel depends mainly crystallographic texture, dislocation density size, distribution second phase microstructure. improved bendability martensitic direct-quenched low-alloy strip steel decreasing subsurface dislocation density hardness well decreasing size carbides. bending tests, specimen exposed heterogeneous stress strain state thickness direction. Therefore, formability V-bending cannot explained simple tensile test. Moreover, correlation microstructure deformation behavior specimen fabricated SLM V-bending process yet addressed.In present study, deformation fracture behavior 316L SS fabricated SLM investigated via mini V-bending tests. effect microstructural heterogeneity exert deformation behavior SLM specimen characterized evolution Kernel average misorientation (KAM), grain boundary (GBs), melt pool boundary (MPBs), Σ3 twin boundary (TBs). fracture behavior V-bending part discussed using two-level finite element (FE) simulations. first-level FE simulation done understand macroscopic deformation specimen V-bending process. second-level FE simulation, representative volume element (RVEs) considered examine stress state crack-nucleation site in/around surface subsurface pore specimen via continuum mechanic approach.2.

IntroductionAustenitic stainless steel grade 316L resistant corrosion due high content chromium nickel typically ranging 16-20 8-12 wt.%, respectively. non-magnetic. Among type austenitic stainless steel, stainless steel (SS) grade 316L mostly used petrochemical, water reactor, nuclear, marine, architectural applications. also used heat exchanger tubes, corrosive chemical environments, automotive industry (Ref 1,2,3,4). Laser beam welding (LBW) become popular fabrication engineering components. non-conventional, non-contact, advanced technique welding similar dissimilar materials. traditional method welding process multi-pass gas metal arc welding, tungsten inert gas welding, submerged arc welding, etc. However, lot disadvantage associated traditional arc welding process necessity groove preparation, low welding speed, high heat input, difficult weld intricate shape, large size fusion, heat-affected zone yield high distortion weldments. overcome issues, laser beam widely adopted welding purpose many industries, automotive industries, microelectronics, aerospace, nuclear, marine, petrochemical industries. LBW process us monochromatic coherent laser light heat source welding cutting purposes. fine, focused laser beam applied, little heat input transferred workpiece material compared traditional arc welding process, favor forming narrow welds. LBW process posse many advantage high energy density, localized heating yield smaller size fusion zone (FZ) heat-affected zone (HAZ), low heat input, deeper penetration, high welding speed, lesser distortion, high productivity, high weld quality, manufacturing flexibility, ease automation, high bead aspect ratio (Ref 5, 6).Laser welding classified two different modes, i.e., conduction keyhole modes, presented schematic diagram Fig. 1. conduction mode welding occurs lower power density le 106 W/cm2 small metal vaporization rate. resulting weld bead size shallower, wider heat-affected zones. keyhole mode welding occurs power density exceeds 106 W/cm2. high energy density, vaporization molten material occurs workpiece surface lead formation small narrow keyhole. diameter keyhole approximately laser beam diameter. vapor cavity keyhole surrounded molten metal. stability keyhole maintained equilibrium vapor pressure, surface tension gradient, hydrostatic pressure. molten metal around keyhole fill cavity laser beam moved along welding line. narrower weld bead size high weld bead aspect ratio achieved keyhole mode welding compared conduction mode (Ref 6,7,8,9). Various kind laser beam like carbon dioxide laser, neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet, newly developed fiber laser employed industry joining purpose. Among type laser beam like CO2 Nd: YAG laser, fiber laser gained great popularity due lesser operating cost compared electron beam welding (EBW). Since operated open atmosphere, however, EBW vacuum chamber essential prevent scattering electron beam. fiber laser attains great popularity high energy density, highly precise due smaller beam spot diameter, deep penetration, high welding speed, lower functional cost, easy weld intricate geometrical shape due easier access beam pas fiber delivery, lesser distortion residual stress weldments, le heat-affected fusion zone (Ref 8,9,10,11). mechanical property weldment much depend beam power, beam focus position, welding speed, focal spot size, shielding gas flow rate. success laser welding depends careful consideration combination input variable like beam power (P), traversed speed (i.e., welding speed, V), beam spot size, beam focus position (f). chance formation welding defect LBW porosity, partial penetration, keyhole instability process variable selected appropriately. Also, laser weldment highly prone crack reduce mechanical property (Ref 11,12,13).Fig. 1Two different welding mode (a) conduction mode (b) keyhole modeFull size imageThe difficulty laser welding SS-316L identification influencing input variable working range attaining superior quality weldments. Following traditional method experimental technique involves considerable number experiment performed, costly. Therefore, statistical design experiment (DOE) like full factorial technique, Taguchi approach, response surface methodology (RSM) extensively employed identify influencing input variable optimum value attaining high quality weldments. Acherjee et al. (Ref 14) used RSM technique build relationship LBW input parameter like welding power, traverse speed, standoff distance, clamp pressure output response like tensile strength fusion zone (FZ) width transmission welding PMMA using diode laser. Hayajneh et al. (Ref 15) conducted welding experiment SS based DOE. successfully identified significant process parameter affecting output response like bending distortion using analysis variance (ANOVA). Anawa Olabi (Ref 16) employed Taguchi method optimization LBW process parameter achieving lesser FZ width area. reported focal point location minimal effect total weld bead area within selected range parameters. However, FZ width area highly influenced welding speed beam power. Sathiya et al. (Ref 17) employed Taguchi approach finding optimal welding condition also develop correlation beam power, welding speed, defocused position penetration depth, FZ width, tensile strength. Caiazzo et al. (Ref 18) employed central composite rotatable design (CCRD) methodology conducting diode laser welding experiments. reported beam power directly affect root width FZ area, whereas inversely affected traverse speed diode LBW Ti alloy. However, grain size fusion zone greatly influenced beam focusing position. Dowden (Ref 19) demonstrated modern view physical interpretation process parameter output response linked deep penetration LBW process. analytical model established Zhou et al.

However, examine FZ microstructure various combination process parameters.From successive study published research articles, found welding austenitic steel using traditional fusion welding method challenging high affinity towards atmospheric gas higher temperature, increase chance weld defects. Therefore, bead shielding essential achieve satisfactory weld quality high energy density welding process. present research work provides experimental guidance design workpiece fixture providing shielding gas flow rate, identify influencing process parameters, understand process-weld morphology, laser butt-welding procedure, precaution must taken care high energy density LBW process.To improve weld quality, obtained previous researcher laser welding SS-316L, particular type fixture (Fig. 2) designed fabricated present study facility provide argon gas minimize weld distortion bead protection environmental contamination welding. date, reported investigation area focused SS-316L using high power CO2 Nd: YAG laser only. systematic investigation using fiber laser conducted study individual well interaction effect beam power, welding speed, defocused position bead features, microstructural characterization, welding defects, mechanical property SS-316L weldments.

Therefore, bead protection environmental contamination welding essential. Figure 5 depicts surface appearance bead plate trial atmospheric condition (absence shielding gas Argon) two different beam power 1600 W 1800 W fixed welding speed 400 mm/min, beam focused workpiece surface, i.e., (f= 0). absence shielding gas (Ar), air particle oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen react molten material form oxide layer. reaction yield poor surface quality weld bead, high degree roughness bead, unsmooth bead surface ripple morphology observed Fig. 5. addition, due oxidation weld bead, surface color weldment changed shiny silver-white color blackish, shown Fig. 5.

Also, shielding gas delivered workpiece top surface co-axial nozzle well 45° laser column surrounding 5 L per minute (Fig. 2) bead shielding environmental contamination. top side nozzle moving welding nozzle. bead plate trials, found higher value flow rate shielding gas top side violent flow molten material take place, lead instability keyhole forming porosity. Also, disruption molten metal top surface occurs higher value flow rate. excessive high flow rate could attenuate incident laser beam. Therefore, spatter start appear workpiece surface. Hence, beam nozzle axis top surface, 5 L per minute flow rate selected. Moreover, maintaining uniformity gas shielding trailing side workpiece, shielding gas supplied side specially designed workpiece fixture. laser welding process posse high welding speed, therefore, welding area need covered fast speed laser beam. Otherwise, shielding gas provided single side lower flow rate, gas may reach end workpiece, trailing side workpiece protected efficiently.The specimens' surface cleaned wire brush acetone welding. standard composition base metal (BM) SS-316L confirmed energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS), presented Fig. 7(a) also provided Table 1. tensile property base metal (BM) SS-316L mentioned Table 2. schematic representation bead feature shown Fig 7(b). metallographic specimen polished per standard method metallographic examination (Ref 46). polished sample etched dipping aqueous solution glyceregia 60s. glyceregia etchant made manually mixing 15 ml glycerine (glycerol), 8-10 ml hydro-chloric acid, 5 ml nitric acid.

Unsuitable welding parameter result many defect unstable weld pool, substantial spatter, excessive penetration, undercut, porosity, loss alloying elements. order achieve high quality weldments, process parameter optimized. Therefore, bead plate trial optimized welding speed, beam power focus position using high energy LBW process.Table 3 Welding parameter rangeFull size tableThe upper limit beam power lower limit welding speed selected based observing distortion weldment acceptable range underfill defect without excessive penetration base material. lower limit beam power upper limit welding speed selected based macroscopic examination bead cross section weldment least 80% penetration depth base plate. Absence visible welding defect crack-free bead weldment selected criterion selecting parameter actual welding experiments. single factor experimental result shown Fig. 8 two different beam power 1600 W 1800 W fixed welding speed 1200 mm/min, beam focused workpiece surface (focus position, f = 0).Fig. 8Penetration depth different beam power (a) 1600 W (b) 1800 W fixed welding speed 1200 mm/min focus position = 0Full size imageThe minimum beam spot diameter achieved beam focused workpiece surface. Therefore, focusing condition, high energy density workpiece surface obtained. However, beam spot diameter increased changing defocusing position either workpiece surface reduces energy density workpiece surface (Ref 34, 48). general, positive defocusing distance lead form stable keyhole, whereas negative defocusing lead form sharp keyhole certain amount porosity level (Ref 35, 49, 50). might explained phenomenon laser beam–material interaction, controlled laser beam spot dimension, also convergent divergent characteristic laser beam inside workpiece material. laser beam divergent positive defocus convergent negative defocusing depicted schematically Fig. 9 (Ref 34, 36, 48). Hann et al. (Ref 51) found keyhole mode welding, vapor pressure developed due vaporization molten material form cavity called keyhole beneath metal surface. Therefore, multiple reflection laser beam keyhole wall inside workpiece surface occur. Hence, suddenly energy density increased considerably inside keyhole; therefore, penetration depth increased significantly. Sometimes, negative defocusing condition keyhole becomes unstable due collapsing vapor cavity/keyhole inside melt pool. lead form porosity inside weld bead. achieve stable keyhole, necessity balance vapor pressure keyhole pressure. vapor pressure responsible keep keyhole open condition welding. However, keyhole pressure try close keyhole. Therefore, magnitude keyhole pressure low keyhole open condition welding progress. lowest keyhole pressure developed higher keyhole diameter low welding speed. case positive defocusing condition, diameter laser beam spot increased; therefore, diameter produced keyhole also increased significantly. Hence, due existence slightly higher keyhole diameter, gas inside keyhole easily exhausted instead form gaseous porosities. addition, balance vapor pressure inside keyhole (Ref 49). Therefore, present study, +1 mm defocusing position laser beam selected attain bigger heating area, turn reduce chance pore evaluation maintain stability keyhole. defocusing position increased beyond +1 mm, diameter laser spot may increase significantly, reduce energy density workpiece surface. Therefore, within selected range beam power welding speed workpiece material may melt down. However, case negative defocusing position, convergent nature beam enhances penetration depth without increase line energy/heat input. Also, threshold energy density initiation keyhole workpiece material lower negative defocusing distance due enhancement laser beam material coupling inside workpiece material (Ref 34, 50). important characteristic LBW posse small line energy. Therefore, minimizing line energy without decreasing energy density inside keyhole adjusting beam power, welding speed, defocusing distance significant importance enhance weld quality term fusion zone size overall bead profile (Ref 52). Similar observation found Kim et al. (Ref 32) laser beam welding T-joint sandwich sheet. Therefore, present study—1 mm defocus position selected.

FZ width area prominently affected heat input imposed workpiece material interaction time heat source BM. study aim find optimum range input parameters, reduces width area FZ. parametric effect FZ width area discussed following subsection.Influence Beam Power Welding SpeedFigure 11(a) show importance beam power FZ width various defocused position (at constant V = 800 mm/min). Fig. 11(a), found FZ width increased increasing beam power irrespective defocused position. primarily due impact increased value line energy increased beam power. line energy (LE) defined ratio laser beam power welding speed. variation LE different beam power shown Fig. 11(b). Fig. 11(b), found increase beam power fixed welding speed 800 mm/min defocused position '0' mm, LE increased. Therefore, higher beam power lead line energy constant welding speed defocused beam position. Therefore, large amount BM melt down, consequently, FZ width (Fig. 11(a)) increased. almost linear relationship observed FZ width beam power various defocused beam position presented Fig. 11(a). However, slope individual curve Fig. 11(a) primarily depends defocused position laser beam.Fig. 11(a) Effect beam power FZ width different defocused positions, (b) variation line energy (LE) different beam power, (c) variation FZ width different welding speeds, (d) 3-D surface plot presenting combined effect beam power welding speed FZ width, (e) variation interaction time welding speedFull size imageFigure 11(c) present influence welding speed FZ width various beam power fixed defocusing distance ‘0’ mm. % contribution welding speed (63.40%, ANOVA Table 5) FZ width higher % contribution defocused position (21.44%) laser beam affect dimension bead shape similar behavior perceived 3D plot (Fig. 11(d).

Fig. 11(e), found increase welding speed fixed spot diameter, interaction time laser heat source workpiece surface reduced. Therefore, heat energy experienced workpiece material also decrease result lesser amount BM melt down, yield narrower FZ width well FZ area (Fig. 12(a)) three-dimensional response surface plot Fig. 12(b). also observed Fig. 11(a) constant welding speed defocused position, FZ width larger higher welding power. attributed keyhole characteristics, material flow inside weld bead, rate plasma absorption. material flow inside weld bead depends keyhole behavior, recoil pressure, temperature-dependent Marangoni effect. Initially, top portion workpiece heated laser beam material start meltdown. minimal duration, molten material depressed recoil pressure form keyhole inside weld bead. formation keyhole, laser beam irradiates keyhole wall vapor evolved plasma around keyhole. Also, multiple beam reflection inner keyhole wall occurs temperature gradient established inside keyhole weld bead. Therefore, due establishment temperature-dependent Marangoni effect, molten material flow center keyhole towards outside boundary weld bead. top region keyhole (location ‘A’ Fig. 12(c)), gravitational effect suppressed combinedly vapor pressure Marangoni shear stress. Therefore, molten material flow outward. flow rate molten metal increase increased beam power, subsequently, solidification molten material, width FZ increased.Fig. 12(a) Influence beam power FZ width various welding speeds; (b) 3D surface plot presenting interaction effect welding power welding speed FZarea, (c) force acting inside melt poolFull size imageInfluence Defocusing DistanceThe energy density primarily influenced change beam power spot area laser beam. Mathematically, defined ratio welding power (P) area laser beam spot (A) workpiece surface. variation power density welding power shown Fig. 13(a). Fig. 13(a), found increase beam power fixed welding speed 800 mm/min beam position (f) '0' mm (beam spot diameter = 200 µm), power density increased. Also, beam spot diameter progressively increased changing defocus position either beneath overhead workpiece surface. Figure 13(b) (c) depicts correlation FZ width defocusing distance various beam power traverse speed, respectively. observing Fig. 13(b), found maximum FZ width achieved defocusing distance −1 mm (1 mm beneath workpiece surface) due multiple beam reflection inner keyhole wall. Further, decreasing defocused position 0 mm, FZ width continuously reduced. likely due steadily decreasing diameter beam spot workpiece surface.Fig. 13(a) Variations power density beam power, (b) influence defocused position FZ width various beam power; (c) 3D surface plot presenting interaction effect beam power defocused position FZ widthFull size imageWhen defocused position kept beneath workpiece surface, laser beam converges gradually focal point. enforces large energy density focal point compared workpiece surface. enhances melting BM, help transmit beam energy considerable depth, thus, penetration depth go deeper. increase defocusing distance beneath metal surface, beam spot diameter continuously increase workpiece surface. present experimental condition, sufficient energy density within investigation range defocusing distance −1 0 mm melt BM completely. Hence, irradiated area front side weld bead increase induces significant molten area. Therefore, FZ width reached maximum point −1 mm defocusing distance. interaction beam power defocused position FZ width presented 3D plot Fig. 13(c).Further, decreasing defocused position beneath workpiece surface, spot area workpiece surface also decreases. Also, known lowest spot diameter laser beam focal point. Hence, bead width continuously decrease −1 0 mm defocused position. increase defocused position center value ('0' mm) +1 mm workpiece surface, laser beam gradually diverged away focus position, induces decreased power density workpiece surface. Also, spot diameter increase continuously lowest value defocused position equal ‘0’ mm maximum +1 mm defocusing distance. increasing spot radius, energy distribution workpiece surface decreased resulting reduced FZ width.Figure 14(a) 3D response plot Fig. 14(b) depict interaction effect defocusing distance welding power FZarea, keeping parameter constant center point. Fig. 14(a), insignificant variation FZarea perceived increase defocusing distance various welding power. percentage contribution defocusing distance le (4.37%, Table 5) comparison welding speed welding power (79.13% 10.42%, respectively, observed Table 5). decreasing defocusing distance −1 0 mm, laser beam progressively converged focal position. Therefore, energy density suddenly increased focal position inside keyhole. Also, multiple beam reflection inner keyhole wall take place favor strong melting vaporization BM. Also, delivers beam energy towards workpiece thickness yielding tapered weld bead. Therefore, FZarea slightly decreased.Fig. 14(a) Influence defocused position FZarea various welding power; (b) 3D response surface plot showing interaction effect beam power defocusing distance FZareaFull size imageFurther increase defocused position, spot radius workpiece surface increases, reduces energy density resulting lesser penetration base plate slight broadening bead shape lower position FZ occurring full penetration. area FZ primarily depends overall bead geometry. Hence, FZ area remains almost constant defocused position ‘0’ mm.Ultimate Tensile StrengthFigure 15(a) depicts influence beam power UTS weldment various welding speed keeping parameter constant center level (Table 3). Also, 3D response surface plot Fig. 15(b) show combined effect beam power welding speed UTS. Fig. 15(a), observed lower joint strength obtained lower beam power, increase increased beam power threshold point, that, start decreasing increased beam power. lower beam power, energy density low due lower penetration depth poor mixing molten material occur. Hence, weak bond formed. However, excellent bond formed higher beam power approximately 1650 W, lead higher tensile strength. Beyond threshold beam power 1650 W, UTS start decreasing irrespective welding speed since element base metal start decomposing reach critical temperature decomposition. decomposition temperature defined minimum temperature material begin crumble chemically. increase power density imposes workpiece surface affect mixing flow behavior molten metal. fixed defocused position, power density function welding power laser spot area workpiece surface. beam power increases, power density also increased (Fig. 13(a)) workpiece surface, resulting increased bead width well FZ area. Also, excellent bond formed higher power density. lead higher tensile strength. lower value power density lead decreased penetration depth poor mixing molten metal causing weak weld. Also, excessive higher beam power higher LE creates degradation evaporation BM. enhances weld defect like underfill excess penetration. welding defect behave stress riser location severely depreciate joint strength.Fig. 15(a) Effect beam power UTS weldment various welding speed, (b) 3D surface plot presenting interaction effect beam power welding speed UTS, (c) effect welding speed UTS different defocused positions, (d) effect defocused position UTS different beam powerFull size imageFrom Fig. 15(a), also found UTS 400 mm/min welding speed lower intermediate welding speed 800 mm/min. probably due instability keyhole combined lower welding speed (400 mm/min) lower beam power 1500 1650 W. lower welding, speed porosity formed within weld bead due instability keyhole reduces joint strength. porosity built lower welding speed, beam power shown Fig. 16(a) (b) Exp.1 11, respectively. Also, combination higher beam power (1650-1800 W) lower welding speed (400 mm/min), higher line energy generated lead evaporation molten metal top region weld bead due excessive penetration underfill weld defect formed, reduces UTS. underfill weld defect shown Fig. 16(c) Exp. 2. However, combination moderate welding speed (800 mm/min) higher beam power (1650-1800 W), top bottom bead width broader (with bigger weld pool) concerning bead width generated combination lower welding speed beam power. intensity surface tension internal static pressure depends keyhole diameter top bottom portion. significant difference diameter upper lower part keyhole. general, keyhole lesser diameter root significant curvature compared top keyhole. Therefore, root keyhole, high value surface tension gradient internal static pressure developed. retain equilibrium, bottom part keyhole, excessive higher vapor pressure generated. Hence, keyhole becomes unstable enhances chance form larger size pore FZ. high welding power (1650-1800 W) moderate welding speed 800 mm/min, larger size molten weld pool formed inside weld bead. Also, 800 mm/min welding speed, cooling rate molten material slower compared higher welding speed 1200 mm/min. Therefore, size keyhole opening larger, help keep keyhole opening prolonged time. Hence, pore getting sufficient time escape welded area. Also, minor fluctuation penetration depth occurs welding condition. Therefore, chance instability keyhole reduced.Fig. 16Porosity FZ (a) Exp. 1, (b) Exp. 11; (c) underfill defect weldment Exp. 2 (Table 4)Full size imageFrom Fig. 15(c), observed tensile strength increase increased welding speed 800 mm/min. that, start declining. probably due different microstructures developed FZ various welding speeds. finer dendritic microstructure formed increasing welding speed 400 800 mm/min due increased cooling rate higher welding speed. welding speed increases, line energy reduced lead higher cooling rate. relationship LE cooling rate depicted schematically Fig. 17 (Ref 54). increase LE, temperature melt pool surrounding BM temperature also increased. Consequently, temperature gradient melt pool surrounding BM reduced. lead decrease rate heat transfer weld pool direction BMZ. Consequently, cooling rate reduced welded area (Ref 54, 55). microstructural development depends cooling rate. faster cooling rate higher welding speed lead finer microstructure FZ, enhancing higher tensile strength (UTS) vice versa. 800 mm/min welding speed, line energy becomes low. Therefore, full penetration achieve base plate lower joint strength.Fig. 17Relationship line energy cooling rate (Ref 54)Full size imageFigure 15(d) present influence defocused position joint strength different beam power. Fig. 15(d), observed UTS weldment maximum −1 mm defocusing distance, decrease decreasing value −1 0 mm. −1 mm defocused position, multiple beam reflection inner keyhole wall occurs, produce deeper penetration base material, explained earlier. Also, average grain size average dendrite thickness become smaller defocused position kept workpiece surface. Hence, maximum UTS observed −1 mm defocusing distance provided full penetration attained base plate.Further changing defocused position beyond 0 mm (above workpiece surface), UTS continuously decreases. defocused position kept workpiece surface, laser beam slowly diverges away focal position, spot diameter laser beam becomes larger. lead decreased power density workpiece surface. Hence, penetration depth continuously decrease increasing defocused position causing reduced UTS.Microstructural AnalysisFigure 18(a) show weld bead cross section Exp. 13 (P = 1650 W, V = 800 mm/min = −1 mm, Table 4).

Nevertheless, need process parameter optimization comprehensive understanding individual complex synergistic effect process parameter geometry, microstructure, property deposited material component. essential ensuring repeatable manufacturing part across single series platform time, minimizing defect porosity. study, response surface methodology (RSM) central composite design (CCD) employed investigate effect laser power, laser scan speed, powder mass flow rate layer thickness, density, microstructure, microhardness 316L steel processed Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS®) DED. Polynomial empirical prediction model correlating applied processing parameter studied response developed. Keywords: directed energy deposition (DED); laser engineered net shaping (LENS®); 316L stainless steel; response surface methodology (RSM); design experiment (DOE) 1. IntroductionAdditive manufacturing (AM) using powder feedstock material become attractive alternative traditional manufacturing process wide variety industry applications. two important branch metal Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) Directed Energy Deposition (DED) [1,2]. two complimentary manufacturing approach set advantage disadvantage [1,3]. advantage DED include, among others, ability print either full part specific features; perform cladding repair within single machine; achieve high deposition rate compliance large components; process multi-materials [4]. Additionally, DED often result denser mechanically stronger printed component compared PBF. larger chamber size DED system allows installation situ detection monitoring instruments, operating software typically “open” PBF system enables investigation effect processing parameter independently, leading comprehensive control microstructure repeatability mechanical property [5]. Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS®) one earliest commercialized DED technologies. developed Sandia National Laboratories licensed Optomec, Inc. (Albuquerque, NM, USA) 1997. Among various metal DED processes, powder-based feedstock laser beam energy source extensively used process. process, two fundamental factor significantly impact quality components: energy delivered per second per unit area powder feed rate per second per unit area [6]. factor significantly influenced laser power, laser scan speed (LSS), powder mass flow rate (PMFR). global energy density (GED) decides amount energy delivered material deposition process. play crucial role determining property DED samples. GED calculated described Ref. [7]: GED[J/(kgsmm3)]=𝑃𝑚⋅𝜈⋅𝑑2beamGED[J/(kgsmm3)]=Pm⋅ν⋅dbeam2 (1) P laser power, PMFR, v LSS, dbeam diameter laser beam. Optimizing GED DED help find balance desired material properties, deposition rate, surface finish, distortion. requires careful consideration various process parameters, laser power, LSS, PMFR, working distance, others, achieve desired outcome specific applications.316L austenitic stainless steel (SS) widely used various applications, including food processing, aerospace, automotive, marine, energy, biomedical, nuclear reactor industry [8]. Due extensive use favorable properties, 316L SS one commonly used alloy techniques, including DED. Svetlizky et al. [5] conducted comprehensive review laser-based DED wide variety materials, including 316L SS. microstructure AM’ed (including DED’ed) 316L SS typically anisotropic depends build orientation heat transfer direction [9,10]. Consequently, mechanical property typically anisotropic [5]. Guo et al. [11] reported tensile property DED’ed 316L SS sample layer scan direction perpendicular tensile test axis better sample whose layer scan direction parallel tensile test axis. Zheng et al. [12] found microstructure evolution LENS® processing 316L SS complex due high thermal gradient dynamic flow fast-moving melt pool associated rapid solidification presence layer-by-layer deposition. laser focus position play critical role determining surface quality DED-deposited components. Selecting laser focused condition effectively prevent accumulation un-melted powder sidewall deposited sections.Despite abundance research focused DED 316L SS, particularly exploring various microstructural facet material property (Table 1), noticeable scarceness study specifically address process parameter optimization methodology systematic elucidation interdependency process parameter pivotal material properties. essential also repeatable manufacturing part across single series platform time minimizing defect porosity achieving desirable mechanical property [13].For instance, Aversa et al. [14] found higher laser power yield denser sample le pores. author concluded lower laser power resulted fine microstructures due higher cooling rates. However, despite increased porosity sample process lower laser powers, sample exhibited superior tensile property inferior dislocation free path compared denser one processed high laser power. Kumaran et al. [15] showed correlation laser power porosity microhardness DED-processed 316L SS. low laser power (400 W), higher LSS resulted porosity lower hardness value due presence un-melted powder particles. medium laser power (600 W), hardness increased due finer grain un-melted powder particle detected. also reported DED-processed 316L SS exhibited higher microhardness PBF-processed steel. tensile tests, DED-processed 316L SS displayed higher elongation, ultimate tensile strength (UTS), lower yield strength (YS), higher strain hardening compared PBF-processed steel. Era et al. [16] investigated effect process parameter (laser power, LSS, energy density, layer thickness) tensile behavior DED’ed 316 SS components. Layer thickness significant impact UTS, increasing layer thickness leading increase UTS. Laser power lowest impact UTS; increasing laser power affect UTS significantly. hand, increased LSS decreased laser energy density resulted decrease UTS. Yang et al.

Results DiscussionSuccessful fabrication 316L single-layer bulk sample using LENS® DED 316L SS substrate achieved, following design specified three-factor rotatable CCD experimental matrix. important note model-building processes, “bias/variance” tradeoff exists. Inclusion term reduces bias increase variance extensive term estimation strain data, leading higher variance. tradeoff especially noticeable ill-posed problem term fitted, necessitating effect selection regularization. Even non-ill-posed cases, effect selection induces regularization, reducing variance potentially introducing bias.In study, second-order polynomial regression prediction model developed using least-square method predict as-deposited 316L single-layer height (h), well density (ρ) microhardness (H) bulk samples. prediction models, expressed presented Equations (3)–(5), encompass quadratic linear terms: ℎ=0.95+67.02×10−4𝑃−60.35×10−4𝜈+0.14𝑚h=0.95+67.02×10−4P−60.35×10−4ν+0.14m (3) 𝜌=8.52−2×10−4𝑃+9.62×10−4𝜈−11.25×10−3𝑚+2.03×10−6𝑃 𝜈+5.05×10−5𝑃 𝑚+12.4×10−4𝑚2ρ=8.52−2×10−4P+9.62×10−4ν−11.25×10−3m+2.03×10−6P ν+5.05×10−5P m+12.4×10−4m2 (4) 𝐻=193.46+0.18 𝜈+0.33 𝑚−0.006 𝜈 𝑚H=193.46+0.18 ν+0.33 m−0.006 ν (5) Note Equations (3)–(5) valid within range variable factor level investigated study, using input factor corresponding unit specified Table 4.Figure 3a–c depicts 3D response surface demonstrating influence variable factor sample density microhardness prediction various factor combinations. sample’s density mapping show density maximized setting low PMFR keeping variable factor center point (see Table 3).

R2 value developed prediction model follows: 0.94 single-layer height response, 0.94 material density response, 0.89 microhardness response (see Figure 2). value indicate fit quality demonstrate effectiveness model capturing relationship investigated variables. Table 5. Summary fit lack-of-fit analyses. Previous study indicated model fit deemed satisfactory R2 value surpass 0.80 [43,47]. study, developed model responses, namely single-layer height, density, microhardness, convincingly meet criterion. Moreover, adjusted R2 value (adj-R2 Table 5) corroborate validity developed model studied responses, discrepancy le 0.2 observed adj-R2 obtained R2 response prediction model [48]. confirms reliably model. lack-of-fit analysis serf ass validity accuracy developed prediction model, taking account either center-point replication (pure error) entire model (total error). case models, lack-of-fit test reveals evidence necessitating complex prediction equation (p > 0.05). important note response surface prediction model remains valid within range factor level specified Table 4. However, beyond levels, model’s prediction might valid, thereby necessitating inclusion additional data point [43,47].Based designed prediction models, response surface curve constructed response depict relationship independent variable factor investigated response respective levels. Figure 4 provides overview effect single-layer height, steel density, microhardness responses, specifically middle level factor. 3.1. Response Surface Analysis Single-Layer HeightThe first set printed sample prepared according DOE parameter (Table 3) single-layer printing. DED, single-layer print crucial step developing process parameter since help obtain optimal layer thickness settings. Layer thickness DED differs meaning PBF. PBF, layer thickness distance working table go layer layer. Thus, distance 50 µm, table go 50 µm rake deposit new powder layer according distance. DED, layer thickness distance depositing head rises. said conditions, thickness built layer either lower higher set layer thickness parameter. variation depends distance deposition head substrate sample. distance high continues increase, cause extremely low energy input, resulting low sample expansion. Conversely, distance deposition head substrate/sample smaller, deposited powder layer might greater thickness. reduce clearance head printed part, potentially causing failed build even machine damage.Visual inspection single-layer trial reveled certain samples, example, produced parameter #10 #15, exhibited insufficient supplied energy achieve desired layer thickness (see Figure 5). hand, sample #5, #12, #16 exhibited excessive height, single layer measuring 6.265, 6.900, 5.186 mm thick, respectively. observation highlight importance carefully optimizing process parameter ensure successful deposition meet required specifications. Figure 5. DED sample produced single-layer height measurements. (a) CAD-file image marked number process parameter combinations. (b) Printed single-layer samples. Another important parameter GED. shown Table 4, different combination laser power, LSS, PMFR yield nearly identical energy density (see sample #1, 3, 4, 10, 12). Energy density directly influence material property deposited samples. Higher energy density result increased melting fusion material, leading denser homogeneous microstructures, lower energy density may result incomplete melting poor bonding layers, leading porosity compromised mechanical properties. energy density determined cooling rate thermal gradient within deposited material. Rapid cooling rate associated higher energy density result higher residual stress increased sample distortion. Controlling energy density DED help manage residual stress level minimize distortion [49]. Energy density also affect build rate productivity DED process. Higher energy density typically result faster melting higher deposition rates, reducing lead time. However, essential balance energy density factor heat dissipation, material properties, process stability ensure quality reliability [7]. example study demonstrate finding optimal energy density necessarily mean finding optimal processing parameters. Single-layer height measurement carried specimens, see Table 3. Sample #15 exhibited negligible growth height 0.150 mm. limited growth explained low energy density (0.6 × 106 [J/(kg·mm3/s)]) also relatively low PMFR. contrast, sample #13 laser power LSS higher PMFR, thus good expansion layer height. Samples #5, 12, 16 highest layer height (6.265, 6.900, 5.186 mm, respectively). Notably, order correspond linearly order energy density value (5.04 × 106, 1.68 × 106, 0.57 × 106 [J/(kg·mm3/s)], respectively). Samples #5 #12 deposited using high laser power, low LSS, different PMFR (10 30 g/min, respectively). explains lower energy density observed sample #12 (m value found denominator energy density calculation). Samples #4, 7, 8, 9, 14 also exhibited excessive single-layer heights.It noted sample high PMFR low GED, sample #2, 13, 14, 15, failed due insufficient energy substitutional amount material deposited. result weak adhesion, lack homogeneity, delamination layers. finding correspond previous data indicating PMFR value higher 10 g/min recommended steel [50]. Deposition sample #15 tried twice—once single layer bulk. However, due combination low PMFR laser power high LSS, growth unsatisfactory. Although possible measure effect parameter single-layer height, bulk sample failed. Lower LSS could improve specimen’s growth, demonstrated sample #10. Another factor contributing limited growth sample #15 could distance nozzle substrate, also known “stand-off distance” “working distance” [50]. stand-off distance influence size shape melt pool. smaller stand-off distance typically lead smaller focused melt pool, larger stand-off distance may result wider spread-out melt pool. choice stand-off distance depends desired melt pool characteristic specific application, e.g., obtaining desired part resolution controlling heat-affected zone (HAZ). case sample #15, first layer successful due relatively adequate working distance; however, distance suitable bulk sample manufacturing resulted failure due continuously increasing stand-off distance.Figure 2a show correlation actual predicted single-layer height. Figure 4 seen increasing laser power PMFR lead increase single-layer height, whereas increasing LSS constant laser power PMFR result reduction single-layer height.

IntroductionAdditive manufacturing (AM) rapidly emerging manufacturing technology used production net-shaped near-net-shaped component directly powder wire feedstock [[1], [2], [3], [4]]. laser-based metal processes, include Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) Directed Energy Deposition (DED), rasterized laser beam melt metal powder pattern progressively fill volume defined CAD model, producing dense functional metallic parts. Among various technology deployed, laser engineered net shaping (LENS®) perhaps one fastest growing DED technique [1,5].The LENS® process eliminates need conventional manufacturing cost associated production startup, making pattern mold required casting metal parts, dy powder metallurgy processes. addition enhanced flexibility fabricating complex geometry fully dense metal [6], time span design model final product significantly reduced use LENS® manufacturing technique.LENS® technology successfully applied research development broad variety material [[7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]], including metallic alloys, metallic matrix composite (MMCs), graded material [15,16] cermets. case metallic materials, various Fe-, Ti-, Ni- Co-based alloy used fabricate component using LENS® [5,7,8,10,[16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]]. many studies, reported property LENS® deposited alloy equivalent exceed material fabricated via traditional manufacturing process [22].As thermal process, DED involves rapid heating, melting, potential vaporization, rapid solidification powder deposited material [1,3]. Currently, stability LENS® microstructures produced far-from-equilibrium processing remains poorly understood. Moreover, produced material exhibit interesting microstructures, current effort devoted characterize physical mechanical performance [23,24]. Interestingly, LENS® process often compared welding technologies, although significant differences, presence marked thermal gradient within small melt pool, fast-moving heat source, multiple scan layer different directions, well exposure material multiple thermal cycles. factor contribute melt pool dynamics, solidification behavior resulted microstructure. high cooling rate (~102–104 K/s) [25] generally gotten LENS® process promote formation metastable non-equilibrium microstructures. Accordingly, material performance component functionality theoretically controlled manipulated, underlying phenomenon completely understood.Despite considerable advance LENS® process optimization, remain various unresolved technical challenge scientific issue related LENS® processing, illustrated Fig. 1. issue shown Fig. 1(a) include: minimizing surface roughness geometric inaccuracies, predicting microstructural evolution complex locally unique thermal cycles, avoiding incorporation un-melted particle porosity, limiting residual stress. melt pool, issue include powder interaction laser beam melt pool, convective turbulent flow keyhole formation, shown Fig. 1(b), critical fundamentally understanding DED processing. issue influenced number process parameter variable laser power intensity profile, powder flow rate, velocity trajectory sprayed powder particles, well scan sequence timing laser passes, change thermal transfer behavior [1,[24], [25], [26], [27]].Download : Download high-res image (763KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1.

Discussion4.1. Solidification complex microstructureIn order understand microstructure evolution LENS® deposited components, important establish thermal behavior solidification condition present melt pool [5,8]. essence, LENS® material processing thermal process, involves heating, melting, possible vaporization, re-solidification deposited materials. Due laser scanning layer additive nature LENS® process, complex thermal history multiple thermal cycle experienced different position build. thermal history associated LENS® process involve partial re-melting top layer, numerous reheating cycle previously deposited layers. complex thermal behavior LENS® process directly influence microstructure evolution. addition, rapidly traversing melt pool formed finely focused laser beam result relatively high solidification velocity cooling rates. order control microstructure evolution achieve desired quality reproducibility fabrication 316L SS components, important understand control thermal solidification behavior.The thermal history deposited component primarily determined heat transfer take place LENS® fabrication. size melt pool small (<1 mm diameter) [18], heat transfer via convection radiation ignored. heat transfer LENS® process primarily dominated heat conduction top layer layer it, well part substrate. Therefore, governing equation heat transfer LENS® process expressed as:(1)ρc∂T∂t=K∇2Twhere c specific heat (J/g °C), ρ density material (g/cm3), K thermal conductivity (W/cm °C). temperature distribution vicinity within melt pool determined, thermal gradient (G = dT/dx) cooling rate (T.= dT/dt) estimated accordingly [47].The microstructures LENS® deposited material consistent associated rapid non-equilibrium solidification. general, directional columnar microstructure columnar growth morphology predominates near interface melt pool microstructures deposited 316L SS [27]. presence localized directional columnar microstructure demonstrates heat flux highly localized unidirectional, crystal grow closely relation direction heat flow.LENS® processing considered dynamic thermal process heat source scanning continuously. laser beam quickly move across substrate, steady state thermal equilibrium form fixed laser reference frame, incoming laser energy balanced thermal dissipation fresh substrate, leaving trail material solidifying behind fast-moving melt pool. thermal equilibrium determines morphology solidification front, growing columnar crystal follow maximum temperature gradient. result variation crystal growth direction, shown Fig. 9(a). existence steady state equilibrium permit estimation solidification front velocity based geometric arguments:(2)R = v · cosθwhere v laser scan speed, θ angle crystal growth direction scan direction.

Schematic diagram illustrating formation mechanism multiple orientational dendritic structure developed LENS® processing: (a) solidification front crystal growth direction, (b) dynamic convective fluid flow melt pool, (c) formation microscale kind interwoven microstructure.The microstructure evolves complex dynamic fluid flow far-from-equilibrium rapid solidification melt pool, shown schematic diagram Fig. 9. reason local change columnar growth direction re-nucleation occurs fragment dendrite arms, fractured dispersed dynamic turbulent convection flow melt pool, shown Fig. 9(b). Variations laser travel velocity also influence columnar direction since growing crystal tend follow highest temperature gradients. change likely responsible formation microscale kind interwoven microstructure, observed solidified track, illustrated Fig. 9(c).A dynamic melt fluid flow generally formed fast moving melt pool induced laser beam laser metal processing, temperature gradient 102–104 K/mm developed center melt pool solid/melt interface [48]. coefficient surface tension generally increase decreasing temperature. surface tension gradient induce drive turbulent fluid flow center melt towards edge. argued Marangoni flow dominant convection mechanism active laser melted pool [49]. Marangoni number, Ma, ratio convection rate conduction rate, metal laser melting condition range 103-106. example, molten steel high Ma, corresponding high Marangoni effect, benefit chemical homogenization via convection, result wider shallower melt pool. Laser melting higher speed promote turbulent convective flow melt pool, increase entrainment surrounding atmosphere may result rough solidification surface [48,50]. complex dynamic fluid flow melt pool also influenced buoyancy convection, perturbation vapor formation impact injected particles.The high temperature gradient dynamic melt flow present melt pool consequently lead complex far-from-equilibrium solidification conditions. extremely high temperature gradient result high solidification rate, provides limited time cell develop complete dendrites. primary dendrite arm initially parallel heat flow direction. High cooling rate trigger formation extremely fine grain structures. melt substantially undercooled, growth crystalline nucleus occurs non-equilibrium condition solid/liquid interface temperature much different equilibrium freezing temperature. Moreover, turbulent convective flow melt pool could carry away dendrite arm dissipate superheat present liquid. small arm dendrite separated carried away slightly supercooled liquid, transported arm grow, new randomly oriented grain formed, illustrated Fig. 9. Convective flow also dissipates superheat liquid metal, thus providing suitable growth location orientation dendritic arms. principle, one envision engineering microstructures mechanical property enhancements, although approach require careful control multiple variable real-time conditions.In addition, millimeter-scale associated inter-passes resultant “woven” structure, shown Fig. 6(a), form result laser mesh-like scanning patterns. such, successive track layer deposited hatch line two adjacent layer angle 90°. Therefore, unique hierarchical microstructure, consisting millimeter-scale inter-pass layered structures, micro-scale inter-cellular colony “partially woven” structure, shown Fig. 6(b), evolved LENS® deposition 316L SS.4.2. Control defectsUnderstanding mechanism govern formation defect DED, especially porosity, evolved important objective scientific community. Generally, two type porosity, lack-of-fusion gas porosity, commonly observed component fabricated via laser-based AM. Lack-of-fusion porosity, shown Fig. 7(d), almost always occurs along layer boundary characterized irregular morphology, mismatch melt pool layer height Z-increment, well hatch spacing set value operator. Lack-of-fusion porosity frequently observed readily avoided proper selection process parameters.The morphology gas pore typically spherical, gas porosity may appear anywhere component, observed Fig. 6(a). Similar case laser welding cladding processes, primary cause gas porosity related fact gas dissolved entrapped melt may sufficient time escape surface melt pool due rapid solidification rate LENS® deposition, therefore leading entrapment gas pore solidification occurs. amount gas porosity deposit generally le 0.5% area [22,51].It suggested direct relationship deposit porosity gas atomized powder used deposition [46]. gas entrapped gas atomized powder particle problematic entrapped gas allowed escape deposition. Internal porosity gas atomized powder particle influenced multiple factor gas atomization. Gas entrapment readily occur disintegration melt atomization, liquid sheet deform collapse spheroid driven concurrent influence melt surface tension shear force develop gas flow [52]. widely reported porosity increase particle size [53]. Accordingly, well-controlled re-melting deposited layer second pas laser beam without additional powder feedstock significantly reduce porosity allowing pore formed first pas escape [46].The formation gas porosity also influenced selection process parameter deposition [51,54]. slow laser traverse speeds, interaction time long, gas pore tend escape melt pool result buoyancy convective flow process [55]. porosity volume fraction melt pool decrease increasing laser traverse speed due insufficient time gas pore travel melt surface. density pore increase increasing laser traverse speed decreasing laser power due reduced time pore coalesce. Additionally, high laser traverse speed low laser power could result lack-of-fusion porosity. Lack fusion region distinguished metallographic cross section un-melted powder particle visible near pore. However, effectiveness increasing laser power reduce porosity limited splatter ejection process known keyhole formation. Porosity formed resulting onset turbulent fluid flow behind keyhole [50], keyhole collapsing quickly allowing melt flow completely fill keyhole solidification take place [56]. Keyhole pore occur primarily root melt pool, phenomenon shown main cause micro-porosity [57]. Hence principle, porosity controlled certain extent properly manipulating process parameters, laser power laser traverse speed, control size temperature melt pool LENS®.The presence un-melted powder agglomerate adhere side wall deposited components, shown Fig. 2(a), related two type possible laser beam misalignment besides laser focal plane setting mentioned above: first, misalignment laser beam focus lens, illustrated Fig. 10(a), second, misalignment focused laser beam powder feeder, illustrated Fig. 10(c).

Besides, nickel-based superalloys better strength, stainless steel lower cost weight (Ref 1, 2). characteristic make two alloy widely used aerospace, chemical, petrochemical, marine high-temperature corrosion industry (Ref 3). However, continuous development industrial fields, component required able operate simultaneously high temperature, high pressure, high-speed rotation extreme load (Ref 4, 5), requires part different mechanical property different directions. Based typical application, mechanical property one alloy (Inconel 625 SS 316L) sufficient. Therefore, researcher proposed use stainless steel/nickel-based FGMs (Ref 6). stainless steel/nickel-based FGMs, composition micro (macro) structure change gradually along one directions, microstructure mechanical property change accordingly (Ref 7, 8, 9). Stainless steel/nickel-based FGMs successfully manufactured include SS 304L-Inconel 625 (Ref 10), SS 316L-Inconel 718 (Ref 11), SS 316L-Inconel 625 (Ref 6) SS 321-Inconel 625 (Ref 12) etc.The emergence additive manufacture (AM) opened new chapter metal-FGM (Ref 13). preparation FGM process alleviate thermal residual stress caused difference thermal expansion coefficient (CTE) bi-metallic interface, thereby solving problem interface cracking (Ref 14). suitable method manufacturing FGM, preparation metal-FGM process greatly promote development FGMs (Ref 15, 16, 17). divided two category based raw materials: powder wire (Ref 18), previous work fabrication stainless steel/nickel-based FGMs process focused metal powder (Ref 19, 20). instance, Su et al. (Ref 21) fabricated SS 316L-Inconel 718 FGMs different composition gradient (5, 10 20 wt.%) laser metal deposition (LMD). Savitha et al. (Ref 6) manufactured discrete compositionally graded SS 316-Inconel 625 FGMs Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS). Carroll et al. (Ref 10) fabricated SS 304L-Inconel 625 FGM directed energy deposition (DED) technology.Compared laser metal deposition (LMD), wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) advantage high raw material utilization, high deposition rate, low equipment cost large-size part, attracted extensive research attention (Ref 22, 23, 24). WAAM process, mixing ratio deposition thickness controlled accurately adjusting wire feeding speed two welding wire different composition, fabrication FGM WAAM become promising solution (Ref 25, 26). Thus, many researcher used WAAM process fabricated FGMs AISI 410-AWS ER70S-6 (Ref 22)), TC4-SS 316L (Ref 27), W-Mo (Ref 28), CoCrFeNi(SiC)x (Ref 25), Fe-FeAl (Ref 29), Ti6Al4V-Inconel 625 (Ref 30), steel-copper (Ref 31) Fe3Ni-FeNi (Ref 32) et al. Similarly, WAAM technology also used manufacture bi-metallic structure composed Inconel superalloy stainless steel (Ref 10). Senthil et al. (Ref 33) proved feasible deposited nickel-based superalloys directly stainless steel Cold Metal Transfer (CMT) technology, Fe Ni element changed significantly interface. defect found interface, Inconel 825 SS 316L combined well, mechanical property interface changed suddenly, hardness tensile strength lower SS 316L Inconel 825. Kumar et al. (Ref 12) manufactured two Inconel 625-SS 304L bi-metallic structure without intermediate layer double wire metal inert gas (MIG) welding. result showed composition Inconel 625-SS 304L bi-metallic structure intermediate layer changed gradually, mechanical property excellent. Zhang et al. (Ref 34) fabricated Inconel 625/HSLA-steel FGM WAAM process, electromagnetic stirring (EMS) technology used improve composition dilution rate, refine grain reduce precipitation Laves phase. result showed EMS auxiliary process helpful improve performance FGM. Therefore, manufacture nickel-based/stainless steel FGM WAAM technology high efficiency low cost future development trend. Among then, kind WAAM process energy, plasma widely used modification alloy preparation coating FGMs (Ref 35, 36).In work, novel process based dual-wire plasma arc additive manufacturing proposed fabrication defect-free reasonable composition distribution SS 316L-Inconel 625 FGM. microstructure, composition distribution mechanical property SS 316L-Inconel 625 along building direction analyzed. According feasibility study, dual-wire plasma arc welding process used manufacture SS 316L-Inconel 625 FGM, provides novel manufacturing process nickel-based/stainless steel FGM.2 Material Methods2.1 Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing SetupThe FGM component SS 316L Inconel 625 deposited dual-wire plasma arc welding system, composed welding power supply (Transmig 550i), two multifunctional automatic argon arc wire feeder (ET-2016), argon gas (99.99% purity) shielding system, six-axis welding robot (Fanuc) robot controller shown Fig. 1(a).

XRD pattern transition zone (50 wt.% SS 316L/50 wt.% Inconel 625) roughly 100 wt.% Inconel 625, show little significant 2 \(\theta \) change. Therefore, prove transition zone also FCC structure (Ref 40). phase evolution due formation unique austenite solidification structure increase Ni element, phase SS 316L-Inconel 625 FGM gradually change ferrite/austenite phase austenite phase (Ref 41) (see Fig. 2(b)). time, XRD pattern also demonstrate peak height \(\upgamma \)(200) plane SS 316L-Inconel 625 FGM region significantly higher planes. Previous research indicated (200) plane relatively high peak represented highly textured columnar dendrite (Ref 40). peak height \(\upgamma \)(111) plane SS 316L region higher region Inconel 625 peak height \(\upgamma \)(200) plane SS 316L lower Inconel 625. Thus, result demonstrate region Inconel 625 columnar dendrite fewer equiaxial dendrites, columnar dendrite crystalline structure uniformly aligned result microhardness value increased (Ref 42). addition, peak observed XRD patterns, existence leaf precipitated phase could proved. However, rule existence second phases. may number precipitated phase small size small detected XRD, test method needed testing.Fig. 2(a) XRD pattern along deposited direction (b) Fe–Cr-Ni ternary phase diagram (773 K) (Ref 39) three composition regionsFull size imageFrom overall cross-section deposition parts, SS 316L-Inconel 625 FGM good bonding multi-layered wall without defect crack pores, shown Fig. 3(a).

Then, addition Inconel 625, content Ni, Cr Mo element increase, solid solution strengthening effect austenite enhanced, microhardness increase (Ref 44). addition, concentration Nb element inter-dendritic region also play crucial role increase microhardness, therefore, microhardness increase increase Inconel 625 (Ref 11, 44). top Inconel 625 region, columnar structure transformed equiaxed structure, microhardness value show upward trend, microhardness value reach maximum (208 HV).Fig. 7(a) Microhardness distribution along deposition direction (b) tensile strain-strength curveFull size image3.4 Tensile TestFigure 7(b) show tensile strain-strength curves, tensile test result presented Table 3. tensile result tensile specimen vertical direction: ultimate tensile strength, yield strength elongation 554.12 ± 7.44 340.79 ± 4.13 26.65 ± 0.27%, respectively. tensile result equivalent tensile property SS 316L-Inconel 625 FGM manufactured LMD technology higher typical property SS 316L obtained forging (Ref 55). tensile result tensile specimen different composition region horizontal direction also presented Table 3. tensile result show ultimate tensile strength yield strength SS 316L-Inconel 625 FGM increase gradually increase Inconel 625 composition gradient 50%. 100 wt.% SS 316L region highest elongation (40.23 ± 2.58%), 50% SS 316L/50% Inconel 625 100 wt.% Inconel 625 region 26 ± 0.98% 28.23 ± 1.24%, respectively. fracture morphology element distribution vertical direction shown Fig. 8, EDS analysis result fracture morphology show Fe Ni element 52 25% respectively. Therefore, fracture position 100 50 wt.% SS 316L/50 wt.% Inconel 625. horizontal tensile test result show tensile property 316L-Inconel 625 FGM increase increase Inconel 625, composition gradient 50%. However, error actual design element distribution due high heat input complex thermal cycle. result, composition region Inconel 625 concentration 20 ~ 30% existed. Previous study shown mechanical property FGM deteriorate within composition range (Ref 21, 40).Table 3 Tensile result specimensFull size tableFig. 8Fracture morphology element distribution tensile specimen vertical directionFull size imagePrevious work shown grain growth direction SS 316L-Inconel 625 FGM part dominated deposition direction. Therefore, microstructure perpendicular deposition direction mostly cellular structure (Ref 50, 56). yield strength inversely proportional size cellular structure, size cellular structure increase gradually increase deposition height (Ref 21). content Inconel 625 low (< 50 wt.% Inconel 625), ferrite disappears (Ref 21), enhancing element Mo Nb segregate formation Laves, heat accumulation resulted size cellular structure increase (Ref 21, 40). Therefore, fracture position tensile specimen vertical direction 100 50 wt.% SS 316L. fracture mode test specimen ductile fracture, fracture surface fibrous, indicating sufficient deformation occurred fracture. fracture morphology deep dimple sharp crack edge, small amount second phase distributed depression, characteristic micropore aggregation ductile fracture. distribution composition show Fe, Ni Cr element uniformly distributed fracture, Mo Nb element segregated. small particle dimple rich Mo Nb elements, related existence Laves phase.4 ConclusionIn present research, thin-walled structure SS 316L-Inconel 625 FGM designed dual-wire plasma arc welding. deposition process achieved changed wire feeding speed SS 316L Inconel 625 welding wire. According phase evolution, microstructure, composition distribution mechanical property building direction examined, following conclusion drawn: (1) FGM composition gradient 50 wt.% SS 316L Inconel 625 successfully manufactured dual-wire plasma arc welding. microstructure dominated columnar equiaxed dendritic structures, primary dendrite arm spacing increased significantly along building direction. microstructure gradually changed FCC + BCC FCC phase.

IntroductionTo move beyond “carbon peak”, recently proposed Chinese government, increased demand meet lightweight requirement automobile, rail transit, shipbuilding industries. industry widely use certain thin-plate materials. However, achieve minimized weight material structures, thinner sheet made material fail meet strength requirements. Therefore, finding economical dependable method connecting dissimilar material utmost importance [1,2,3].A better lightweight alternative use Al alloy stainless steel [4] connections. highly economical, lightweight 6××× series Al alloy, offering superior corrosion resistance, often used various application [5,6,7]. Austenitic SS widely utilized aircraft parts, ship parts, auto part due excellent corrosion resistance sound weldability. welding heat input lead mutual diffusion aluminum iron form intermetallic compound (IMC). welding interface, Al Fe form high-quality connection, mainly formation micron-sized uniformly distributed IMC [8,9]. 6061-T6 Al alloy small amount Si, thickness IMC slightly reduced, thereby improving microstructure property welding joint [10]. Therefore, combination two material attracted widespread attention various application field [11,12,13,14,15], new energy vehicle frames, connection tailor-welded blanks, sealing covers, thin-walled structures.There still crucial question answered choose connection method SS Al alloy. traditional fusion welding method, higher heat input produce thicker IMC layer. may lead crack propagation reduce mechanical property joint. comparison, friction stir welding (FSW) numerous advantages. Primarily, low welding-heat input reduce sheet deformation. Furthermore, produce welding defect caused molten state, pores, burn-through, cold cracks, hydrogen embrittlement. Additionally, thickness IMC layer generated Al-Fe interface precisely controlled [16]. reported [11,17], induction heating using FSW technology achieved good results. Nevertheless, safety risk heightened adding auxiliary device increase welding energy.At present, research friction stir welding Al-Fe material explores use medium thick plate (thickness 1 mm). Ramachandran et al. [9] conducted experiment FSW AA5052-H32 hot-rolled HRSLA steel IRSM42–93 3 mm thickness rotational speed 500 rpm, welding speed 50 mm/min, welding axial force 7 KN. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) used observe distribution IMC thickness produced tapered cylindrical straight cylindrical tools. observed IMC distribution Al-Fe interface cylindrical tool taper 10° uniform. comparison straight cylindrical tool, geometric shape tapered cylindrical tool conducive generation IMC bottom Al-Fe interface. X. Liu et al. [8,18] welded 6061-T6 aluminum alloy phase transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP). found welding speed could affect type IMC tool’s rotational speed increased strain rate materials. material strain rate increased static dislocations, mobile dislocations, crack caused grain boundary deformation. Therefore, compared conventional FSW (tool rotation speed < 2000 rpm), higher rotation speed improve diffusion process produce IMC. connection welding materials, formation appropriate thickness IMC layer Al-Fe interface important. However, F. C. Liu et al. [19,20] found higher rotational speeds, formation IMC inhibited, nano-scale amorphous phase form.Micro friction stir welding (µ-FSW) refers FSW thickness le 1 mm. thin plates, micro friction stir welding present feasible connection method Al alloy SS. Chen et al. [21,22,23] pointed high rotation-speed FSW improve degree material mixing, le material thinning, reduce machine rigidity needed. HRS-FSW (High rotation speed-FSW) higher 2000 rpm lower 15,000 rpm, realize μ-FSW connection. FSW connection made lower axial force. reduces rigidity requirement machine, beneficial case welding robot applications.The high rotational speed FSW attracting increasing amount attention. Mohan et al. [24] combined µ-FSW ultra-high rotational speed friction stir welding (ultra-HRS-FSW) weld AA1100 thickness 1.0 mm. rotation speed ultra-HRS-FSW range 15,000 24,000 rpm. welding speed could attain 1000 mm/min, improves welding efficiency. existing literature HRS-FSW dissimilar material connection focus connection similar material dissimilar material comparable thermomechanical properties. example, Zhang et al. [25] conducted µ-FSW weld brass (H62) copper (T2), thickness 0.6 mm, rotational speed 12,000 rpm, welding speed 280 mm/min. relatively high tensile strength 194 MPa achieved, approximately 82.6% copper (T2). concluded welding process parameter greater effect quality welding thin plate tool geometry. Park et al. [26] conducted test µ-FSW AA6061-T6 AA5052-H32 plate thickness 1 mm, rotation speed 9000 rpm welding speed 300 mm/min, reach highest tensile strength 226.63 MPa. concluded welding heat input lower higher speed. Additionally, using backing plate higher thermal conductivity serious impact material connection. However, connection problem dissimilar sheet material still unresolved. Based current studies, concluded high rotational speed beneficial µ-FSW’s connection include similar different material comparable thermomechanical properties. However, µ-FSW Al-Fe, physical mechanical property aluminum alloy steel extremely different, binding mechanism completely different different material thermodynamic properties. addition effect rotational speed welding parameters, previous study reported specific effect tool offset joint characteristics.In abovementioned studies, Al-Fe welding studied mainly term medium-thick plates. Thin plate studied mainly term welding dissimilar material similar material comparable thermomechanical properties. relevant study Al-Fe µ-FSW, using ideal lightweight material. addition rotation speed, important welding parameter µ-FSW joint, offset tool considerable influence material fluidity mechanical property joint. Therefore, paper aim investigate feasibility different process parameter Al-Fe plate HRS super-HRS-FSW, summarize advantage disadvantage microstructures mechanical properties, analyze formation IMC gain insight intrinsic mechanism. 2.

Consequently, heat generation increased, middle part SS welding interface changed plastic state. Therefore, local aluminum alloy brought SS side and, Al-Fe interface, 25° inclination angle formed. However, ultra-HRS parameters, inclination angle Al-Fe interface reduced 13°, Al-Fe interface, part SS flowed aluminum alloy. shown red-circled area Figure 4c,d. plastic material affected area shoulder tended squeeze tool pin inclination angle tool shoulder. According Bernoulli effect, rotation speed welding speed increase, linear speed material interface area reach 306.7 mm/s, resulting drop interface pressure.

Thermal History Formation Diffusion Layer Al-Fe InterfaceThe key influencing factor contribute formation IMC welding Al-Fe dissimilar metal heat input axial pressure [4,33]. Therefore, necessary measure temperature welding process. using different offsets, slight temperature differences. Figure 10 show temperature measurement data HRS ultra-HRS parameters. highest temperature measured HRS ultra-HRS connection method 470 °C 620 °C, respectively. highest temperature lower 655 °C, Al-Fe eutectic point. paper Mahoney [34], found temperature difference along direction thickness almost negligible. Since thinner thickness used experiment, temperature considered direction thickness. experimental temperature measurement point close thermal mechanically affected zone RS. Therefore, welding process, measured temperature point could considered closest highest temperature. Figure 10.

Without taking account amount energy released plastic deformation tip tool pin, middle layer tool pin chosen minimum shear band thickness. shear band thickness 0.116 mm 0.022 mm, respectively. Therefore, average shear strain rate 1.3 × 103 s−1 1.2 × 104 s−1, respectively. relationship diffusion coefficient D, jump distance λ diffusion atom, jump frequency atom = λ^2 Γ/6. 450 °C 620 °C, according literature [35,36], diffusion coefficient Al Fe 3 × 10−15 m2/s 6 × 10−14 m2/s, respectively, distance Fe Al atom 2 nm. atomic jump frequency 1.35 × 104 s−1 9 × 104 s−1 higher average shear strain rate, shear completely inhibit atomic diffusion. Consequently, IMC interlayer formed. Figure 11.

Yeremenko et al. [32] also obtained similar IMC components. found HRS ultra-HRS parameters, role spindle rotation speed dominant, IMC type little influence welding temperature, welding heat input, welding speed, tool offset. different impact rotation speed tool offset case IMC type described Liu et al. [8]. difference occurs simultaneous diffusion reaction. Atomic diffusion inhibited high shear rate, atomic diffusion make atomic chemical reaction almost impossible. Thus, diffusion reaction occurs.

Figure 13, peak value hardness RS weld due driving effect tool pin. hardness HAZ SS matrix decreased gradually. width HAZ RS larger ultra-HRS method, shown Figure 13, HAZ SS nearly same. main reason friction area shoulder SS small, thermal conductivity SS poor. Except nugget area, hardness upper region observed different middle lower lines. center stir zone base material, noticeable decrease hardness Al side, substantially correlated significantly increased grain size, along dislocation density [44]. Interestingly, hardness upper surface relatively lower value, may attributed coarse grain grown due resulting overheating rotational shoulder. hand, hardness top layer always exhibited slightly higher value middle bottom layers, since transformation austenite martensite easily induced heat generated FSW. phenomenon identified Lee [33], conjecture RS verified weld’s magnetic conductivity end welding.

However, enlarged area Figure 5e, seen thickness SS IMC layer near aluminum alloy side uniform. lowest thickness least 7 µm, mechanical property improved thickness IMC layer uniformly distributed 2 µm, Al-Fe interface [9]. excessively thick IMC layer would result crack propagation [45]. shown Table 4, thickness IMC layer Al-Fe interface uniform, average thickness 2 µm. differs finding Ramachandran et al.

Weld fracture caused three major factors: effect ultra-high rotational speed centrifugal force welding materials, thermal mechanically affected zone, upward flow material caused small axial pressure. Consequently, hole produced welding core, source fracture. 3.6. Fracture AnalysisFigure 15 show typical SEM fracture image fractured tensile sample condition HRS low offset Ultra-HRS high offset.

IMC compound uniformly distributed Al-Fe interface, weld break Al-Fe adhesion interface outside stirring pin RS.Under high rotation speed ultra-high rotation speed, welding temperature, welding speed, tool offset little influence IMC type. High rotation speed mean high shear rate, directly affect interatomic diffusion, thereby affecting type intermetallic compound produced. Therefore, rotation speed play crucial role type IMC.The tensile strength iron-rich phase (Fe3Al) joint interlayer high aluminum-rich phase (FeAl3) joint interlayer. case joint obtained ultra-HRS-FSW, SS block cut high stirring lead formation loose hole joint decrease connection strength. iron-rich phase (Fe3Al) better corrosion resistance.According hardness analysis, hardness top layer joint found substantially different middle lower layers. aluminum side lower hardness level steel side. difference hardness related high tool rotation speed aluminum alloy side, higher friction, plastic deformation caused high-speed rotation shoulder. grain side aluminum alloy absorbs energy, material softens, SS transformed martensite result temperature change plastic deformation.When tool offset 0.7 mm HRS-FSW ultra-HRS-FSW welding methods, along intermetallic compound Al-Fe interface, mixed zone iron aluminum formed. tool offset 0.55 mm, intermetallic compound formed Al-Fe interface.From findings, concluded although mechanical property ultra-HRS-FSW joint high HRS-FSW joints, iron-rich phase produced ultra-HRS-FSW better strength, toughness corrosion resistance. Future research focused improving ultra-HRS-FSW connection modes, improving shape stirring head adding auxiliary pulse induction heating vary microstructure distribution joints. Finally, improved method process lead formation excellent welds. Author ContributionsData curation, Y.Z., H.Z., X.C., M.S., Z.Y., Y.G. L.M.; writing—original draft, Y.G., L.M., S.C.

IntroductionDissimilar metal weld (DMW) joint ferritic-martensitic steel austenitic stainless steel commonly utilized steam generator thermal nuclear power plants. Austenitic stainless steel (AISI 304/316) employed high temperature side final stage superheaters reheaters good oxidation resistance excellent creep strength required, described Tseng Hsu (2011). lower temperature side primary boiler heat exchangers, le expensive ferritic steel (2.25Cr-1Mo steel/9Cr-1Mo steel) preferred owing good creep strength. Brentrup DuPont (2013) reported thousand ferritic-austenitic DMWs typical power plant.DMWs P91 steel-AISI 316 L stainless steel (SS) generally fabricated Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) welding process. However, conventional TIG welding shortfall limited thickness penetration capacity single pass, tedious joint preparation procedure, also requires large number passes; turn reduce productivity reported Vidyarthy et al. (2016). weld joint typically made austenitic stainless steel filler (16-8-2) nickel based filler (Inconel 82/182) deal mismatch mechanical, physical metallurgical property dissimilar metal welded. However, Sireesha et al. (2000) reported Inconel 82/182 16-8-2 consumables susceptible hot cracking; therefore, careful control welding parameter required. Additionally, ferritic-austenitic DMW joint fail ahead design life due various heterogeneity physical property microstructure. DuPont (2012) discussed cause premature failure transition joint mainly thermal stress due coefficient thermal expansion mismatch, carbon migration, formation oxidation notches.Carbon migration across ferritic steel-weld zone interface known major factor reduces weld service life. prolonged exposure high temperatures, e.g., post weld heat treatment high temperature service, interstitial diffusion carbon atom take place ferritic steel side weld zone. thermodynamics point view, discussed Sudha et al. (2002), partitioning carbon caused difference chemical potential carbon, i.e., carbon activity either side base metal-weld zone interface. chemical potential gradient base metal weld zone occurs due difference content carbon carbide forming element chromium, molybdenum, silicon, etc. According Huang Wang (1998), diffusion carbon lead formation carbon denuded soft region ferritic steel side weak term creep strength; carbon enriched region high hardness high creep strength weld zone. Therefore, formation two adjacent region physical chemical heterogeneity across narrow distance (less 250 μm) trigger failure carbon depleted zones. major approach retard rate carbon migration reported literature are- a) reduction carbon diffusivity weld zone (Rathod et al., 2017) b) decreasing driving force, i.e., carbon activity gradient across interface (Brentrup DuPont, 2013).Reduction carbon diffusivity attained changing microstructure closely packed austenitic structure carbon diffuses much slower austenite phase ferrite phase. Additionally, high nickel content weld metal recommended carbon diffusion rate alloy slow. Therefore, approach like buttering ferritic side nickel based filler use weld metal high nickel content used reduce diffusion coefficient. Another approach reducing carbon migration reducing chemical potential gradient gradual change composition carbide forming elements. gradual change concentration alloying element functionally graded material (FGMs) could also reduce extent carbon migration according Brentrup et al. (2012). However, Brentrup DuPont (2013) found applicability FGMs limited due manufacturing related issue unavailability metal powder form inability control metal deposition rates.From recent study, Vidyarthy et al. (2017) observed Activated Tungsten Inert Gas (A-TIG) welding P91 steel-AISI 316 L SS resulted gradual change chemical composition ferritic austenitic side. Ramkumar et al. (2015b) also observed weld zone A-TIG welded Inconel 718-AISI 416 dissimilar couple yield chemical composition intermediate two base metal turn result smooth transition elemental distribution. Kulkarni et al. (2018) studied carbon migration phenomenon dissimilar P22 steel-P91 steel combination. reported A-TIG weld joint reduces severity carbon migration due reduced carbon activity gradient across interface compared conventional multi pas weld joints. A-TIG welding variant autogenous TIG welding layer flux coated plate surface prior welding. melting evaporation flux, surfactant induced weld pool alters weld pool motion ultimately improve depth penetration. Vasudevan (2017) reported austenitic stainless steel plate thickness 12 mm joined single pas A-TIG welding. Sakthivel et al. (2011) reported A-TIG weld joint AISI 316 L N SS exhibited better creep strength multi pas TIG weld joints. Ramkumar et al. (2015a) also reported overmatching joint strength decent impact toughness A-TIG welded super duplex-austenitic stainless steel combination. Moreover, compared multi-pass TIG welding, significant cost reduction observed fabrication ferritic-austenitic DMW joint A-TIG welding assessed Sharma Dwivedi (2019a). Massive enhancement depth penetration coupled excellent mechanical property weld joint make A-TIG welding process promising.However, A-TIG welding transition metal joint used power plant studied thoroughly. A-TIG welded DMW P91 steel AISI 316 L SS developed Vidyarthy et al. (2017) reported exhibit excellent strength. However, joint showed low impact toughness due hard brittle martensitic structure weld zone. Similar observation made A-TIG welding P92 steel AISI 304H stainless steel Sharma Dwivedi (2019b). Moreover, martensitic structure make weld joint susceptible cold cracking low solubility hydrogen discussed Kurt et al. (2009). Additionally, autogenous nature, A-TIG welded dissimilar metal weld zone allow many alternation microstructure. Hence, order make A-TIG welding transition joint lucrative effective, modification weld metal microstructure helpful get optimum combination mechanical property metallurgical stability.Microstructural modification single pas autogenous welding previously attempted plasma arc welding use metallic interlayer sandwiched substrate welded. Kurt et al. (2009) used AISI 316 L SS interlayer order improve impact strength weld joint AISI 420 martensitic stainless steel. similar attempt made Teker (2013) improve mechanical property AISI 430. However, study revealed weld joint thickness penetration single pas welding even higher heat inputs. Therefore need develop process produce weld joint full thickness (8 mm) penetration single pas desirable microstructure.In work, attempt made make alteration microstructure A-TIG welded DMW joint 8 mm thick plate P91 steel AISI 316 L SS introducing ferrous based (Incoloy 800) nickel based (Inconel 600) interlayers. effect interlayer metallurgical mechanical property DMW joint studied.

One over-arching commonality across nearly testing modes, observation additively manufactured metal can, often do, behave drastically different conventionally fabricated counterparts. many cases, performance differential result reduced properties, always. Factors frequently posited negative contributing influence include significant residual stress accumulation build (Li et al. 2018) and/or porosity content resulting lack fusion solidification shrinkage (Salzbrenner et al. 2017; Boyce et al. 2017; Wycisk et al. 2014). However, investigator found optimizing phase content yield superior performance conventionally produced material via careful control thermal history case Ti–6Al–4V (Xu et al. 2015, 2017). Additionally, Zhao et al. (2009) Finfrock et al. (2018) reported hot isostatic pressing (HIP) additively manufactured metal greatly reduced apparent quantity volume internal voids, quantifiably increased sample density, reduced variation geometric dimension samples, greatly increased ductility. observation also coincided diminished variability associated tensile strength HIPed sample compared as-built additively manufactured parts. example highlight complexity performance associated as-built material comparison conventionally fabricated counterpart also compared material modified post-processing geometric modification. third Sandia Fracture Challenge (SFC3) explored performance differential within additively manufactured material demonstrating variability 316L stainless steel structure large stress concentration reduced compared uniform tensile specimen produced within build (Kramer et al. 2019).In study, additively manufactured sample SFC3 (Kramer et al. 2019) used ass mechanical response 316L stainless steel, tension, deliberately designed stress-concentrating interior channels, well as, randomly dispersed, mono-modal, porosity. Interrupted tensile testing specimen second AM-build SFC3 specific target level deformation performed. Following unloading interval, specimen scanned using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) characterize void growth damage evolution reloaded next target deformation. process repeated failure. Post-test fractography, micro-CT scan increment, global load versus displacement behavior identify void grow deformation lead variation crack evolution. paper, experimental testing SFC3 specimen including interrupted tensile testing, micro-CT scans, characterization void fracture evolution, described. discussion effect void failure suggestion future work also provided.2 Experimental approach2.1 Mechanical testingFor SFC3, commercial vendor fabricated two identical build 316L stainless steel machine order reduce variability builds. One builds, denoted “Build A”, used main challenge, summarized Kramer et al. (2019). current study utilized second build, denoted “Build B”. Twelve Challenge-geometry specimen “Build B” investigated; Fig. 1a show drawing Challenge geometry. Six specimen pulled monotonically failure done nineteen Challenge-geometry specimen “Build A”. six underwent interrupted testing specimen tested pre-determined level deformation unloaded four separate times, fourth increment ending failure. test specimen interrupted interval 1 (I1) middle structural hardening; interval 2 (I2) peak load; interval 3 (I3) discernible appearance first crack front surface; interval 4 (I4) complete failure. One specimen underwent slightly different interruption pattern: B15 experienced grip slip I3, specimen unloaded reloaded tightened grips. second loading I3, crack began unstably fail displacement could paused, leading extensive damage, complete failure. Specimen B15 underwent one final interval (I4) small amount load required completely fail specimen. Comparison data I3 I4 B15 specimen must considered loading variation mind.Each interrupted test specimen scanned using X-ray micro-CT testing deformation increment, totaling five scan per specimen. Despite variation loading history, B15 still five scans; scanned two loading I3. micro-CT scan visualized internal void structure, void growth, crack evolution.

Unfortunately, grand goal supported data study. Here, established global mechanical behavior Challenge geometry strongly correlated metric pre-existing void populations, even considering different volume interest ranging entire gage section multiple localized geometric sub-volumes near high-stress intersection point specimen. stress concentration geometry appears dominate global mechanical response, tempering stochastic nature mechanical response specimen uniform cross-sections build (Kramer et al. 2019); study corroborates conclusion SFC3.Despite lack correlation aggregate void global mechanical behavior, void observed influence local crack initiation growth. four nominally equivalent ligament around through-hole angled channel allowed comparison crack initiation growth different void population specimen addition providing comparison ligament across specimens. two identified failure initiation mode observed: (1) crack initiating high-stress intersection point through-hole angled channel intersected (2) crack initiating significant distance away high-stress intersection point surface defect. specimen one ligament crack initiating surface defect, I1. eighteen ligament initiated high-stress intersection point, four I1, ten I2, four I3. obvious local internal void metric correlated interval crack initiation starting high-stress intersection point. void metric used study include surface defects, pre-test scan used possibility predicting mode failure. centroid surface defect initiate crack anywhere 74 736 \(\upmu \)m away high-stress intersection point five six 200 \(\upmu \)m away. contrast, crack starting near high-stress intersection point 11 325 \(\upmu \)m away, three eighteen 200 \(\upmu \)m away. variation crack initiation location near high-stress intersection point likely due local surface roughness perhaps due slightly unequal sharing load four ligaments, affected factor imperfect tensile loading, prior cracking regions, geometric difference four region build. twenty-four nominally equivalent regions, crack initiated within 750 \(\upmu \)m high-stress intersection point, eighteen within 200 \(\upmu \)m, implying high-stress intersection point geometry dominated crack initiation. hand, surface defect able alter crack initiation site fairly prevalent recurring nominal location. surface defect tended large and, four specimens, larger internal void corresponding region. observation show voids, specifically surface defects, impact crack initiation structure large stress concentrations, void need sufficiently close stress concentration, different geometry void population. study find obvious metric guide development relationship void population, geometry, crack initiation; research needed delve interplay factors.With respect crack growth, void certainly influenced behavior, fracture surface mostly classic ductile dimple several intersected voids, seen fractography B10 B33 Figs. 7 9, 10, 11, 12. four fracture surface specimen differed one another due variation void population region. expected, void volume grew increasing deformation regardless involvement fracture, seen 3D reconstruction void different interval B10 Region 3 B33 Region 1, growth, void became ever increasing stress concentrators. void led deviation nominal crack path along angled channels, evidenced abrupt vertical change B10 Region 3 (Figs. 9 11). case, author lack intuitive hypothesis crack intersected certain void others vicinity despite void vicinity growing similar rate I3. Also, void small detect pre-test micro-CT scan grew considerably eventually intersected crack. demonstrated B10 Region 3 undetected void affected crack growth void near crack intersected, clear non-destructive evaluation metric void population could established study predict fracture current micro-CT technology scanning macro-scale part resolution ranging 5 20 \(\upmu \)m.Nevertheless, observed surface defect large void encourage crack grow quickly. Cracks starting surface defect grew faster and/or grew larger volume. Material crack accumulated damage faster compared material smaller stress concentration; thus since crack associated surface defect tended fail I1, could grow faster larger. Excluding surface-defect cracks, region greater number large void tended crack grew faster; though still noteworthy, strong correlation since void quantified Fig. 14 could located anywhere rectangular volume interest shown Fig. 6b. mean large void given region might reasonably far early damage. Despite variation individual region, accumulated crack volume specimen vary greatly specimens. another example void population local effect, agglomerate response correlate specific void metric. Also, though global mechanical behavior specimen vary much, strong correlation accumulated crack volume global mechanical behavior. Fracture local event intuitively relates global mechanical behavior part. Here, void seen influence fracture initiation growth, obvious connection void mechanical behavior remains yet elusive. stress concentration dominant case, raise question cross-over point located void becoming primary driver mechanical behavior happens transition region geometric stress concentration void population matter equally.5 Future workThis study first step investigating evolution fracture metallic structure incipient voids. work needed deconvolve influence several variable including void size, void location, void population, surface roughness, geometric feature overall mechanical response. accomplish this, author propose five different case monotonic tensile testing failure carried conjunction interrupted tensile testing via micro-CT (or via situ tensile testing micro-CT):1.an AM-built structure through-hole angled channel features;2.an AM-built tensile bar surface roughness removed through-hole angled channel feature machined part;3.a wrought-metal tensile bar through-hole angled channel feature machined part;4.an AM-built structure through-hole angled channel feature undergone HIPing; and5.an AM-built tensile bar surface roughness removed through-hole angled channel feature machined part undergone HIPing.Case 1 essentially repeat current study, removal internal feature fail; case allows direct comparison case machined features. Case 2 considers structure pre-existing voids, without surface roughness. Comparison Cases 1 2 would explore surface roughness affect fracture initiation, case still could crack initiation surface defect still crack deviation damage accumulates. Case 3 control case investigating fracture evolution (initiation high-stress intersection points, crack path along angled channels, mode fracture) due specimen geometry without influence void surface roughness. base material property wrought 316L would different 316L, comparison mechanical response structure would qualitative. Case 4 considers fewer and/or smaller-sized void resulting HIP process (Zhao et al. 2009; Finfrock et al. 2018) might change fracture evolution, similar surface roughness Case 1. Case 5 similar Case 2, different void distribution HIP process. Case 5 likely closest Case 3 316L base properties.Computational simulation case would also support deconvolution primary variables. simulation could direct numerical simulation (DNS) mesh actual structure measured via micro-CT. Additional base material test wrought 316L, similar SFC3 (Kramer et al. 2019), could also conducted parameterize material model base material expectation certain amount voided volume fraction.Additional test could performed part stress concentration geometry varied investigate interplay void specimen geometry. geometry could varied uniform tensile bar geometry different notch radius geometry like SFC3. would allow query critical void characteristic (e.g. void size, shape, location, number) relative stress concentration geometry characteristic (e.g. local radii, number ligaments, ligament cross sectional area) lead (a) local variation fracture evolution (b) variation global mechanical response.6 ConclusionThis study detail reinvestigation ductile fracture behavior SFC3 Challenge-geometry 316L SS specimens, considering effect pre-existing void process damage failure.

However, research gap characterization geometric tolerance LPBF parts. literature survey reveals three significant research gaps: (1) systematic design benchmark geometric tolerance characterization minimum experimentation; (2) holistic geometric tolerance characterization different orientation varying feature sizes; (3) comparison results, without base plate. research article focus addressing issue systematically designing benchmark characterize geometric tolerance three principal planar directions. designed benchmark simulated using finite element method, manufactured using commercial LPBF process using stainless steel (SS 316L) powder, geometric tolerance characterized. effect base plate removal geometric tolerance quantified. Simulation experimental result compared understand tolerance variation using process variation base plate removal, orientation, size. tolerance zone variation validate need systematically designed benchmarks, also tri-planar characterization. Simulation experimental result comparison provide quantitative information applicability numerical simulation geometric tolerance prediction LPBF process. Keywords: laser powder bed fusion (LPBF); benchmark test artifact; numerical simulations; dimensional metrology; geometric dimensioning tolerancing (GD&T) 1. Introduction BackgroundAccording ISO/ASTM 52900:2015 [1], additive manufacturing (AM) defined “process joining material make part 3D model data, usually layer upon layer, opposed subtractive manufacturing formative manufacturing methodologies.” also commonly known “3D printing”. developed early 1980s shown great promise ability produce complex custom geometrical shape wide range material [2]. Common process material extrusion, vat photopolymerization, directed energy deposition, laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) [3]. LPBF process metal us laser source energy fuse layer metal powder. laser melt defined path layer deposited metal powder. bed move down, another layer metal powder thickness 20–100 µm deposited. process repeated part completely manufactured. binder used process. process produce fully dense metal part ready industrial use limited post-processing needs. widely used metal process various application automotive, aerospace, biomedical industry [4]. Although made transition research lab industry last decade, various challenges, geometric tolerance control manufactured parts, low repeatability, controlling deviation due residual stress still need addressed [2]. define challenges, output characteristic part must understood categorized follows:Mechanical characteristics, tensile, compressive, flexural strength;Material characteristics, microstructure porosity;Surface characteristics, surface roughness wear properties;Geometric characteristics, dimensional accuracy geometric tolerances.These output characteristic dependent various process parameters, layer thickness, scan strategy, part orientation. Standardized procedure already established mechanical, material, surface characteristic testing quantification [5,6,7]; however, standardized method quantification assessment geometric characteristic still infancy metal [8,9]. Like manufacturing process, additively manufactured part also deviation error compared input CAD data. Understanding deviation variation critical engineering design manufacturing. example, higher frequency part rejection typical precision applications, high degree geometric control challenging. Variations final part’s geometry occur due process physics, various process parameters, manufacturing conditions. Resulting “geometric deviations” “geometric errors” need quantified assessed advance ensure required dimension geometric tolerance part met.To date, method geometric tolerance assessment process yet completely defined standardized. Experimental method based geometric benchmark test artifacts, GBTAs [10,11], aim providing quantitative information various geometric tolerance characteristics. brief comparison common GBTAs available literature presented geometric tolerance perspective Table 1. feature manufactured GBTAs used characterize different dimensional geometric tolerance [12,13,14,15]. GBTA experiment followed ranking optimizing manufacturing parameter influence geometric tolerances, information used optimize parameter actual manufacturing. example, Shahrain et al. [16] varied 13 process parameter fused deposition modeling printer and, based experimental result flatness cylindricity, parameter ranked optimized meet required geometric tolerance subsequent prints. References [12,13,17,18,19,20,21,22] provide similar studies, geometric tolerance manufactured GBTAs characterized. Table 1. Comparison selected GBTAs according geometric tolerance characteristics. Even though study provided great starting point study, application predicting geometric tolerance part manufactured machine questionable. due lack feature GBTA quantify certain geometric dimensioning tolerancing (GD&T) characteristic per ISO 1101 [23]. step cylinder concentricity, parallel flat feature parallelism, on. inability available GBTAs provide accurate reliable information geometric tolerance actual part make unsatisfactory geometric quality characterization. comparative study various GBTAs tested LPBF corresponding geometric tolerance shown Table 1. comparison show GBTA characterized geometric tolerances, characteristic quantified three principal planar directions. removal support structure base plate also considered GBTA design measurements. Moreover, numerical simulation tool used conduct geometric tolerance prediction GBTAs manufactured.The comparative study highlight state-of-the-art GBTA design limitation characterize critical GD&T, well crucial geometric quality parameters, minimum feature size fit assembly. experimental method conducted systematically designed benchmarks, lack proper design experiments, based directly application geometry, trial-and-error based. such, multiple repetition required various parametric changes, actually add geometric information eventually add increasing costs. Thus, costly metal large build volumes, repeated benchmark experimentation feasible. Significant limitation various benchmark artifact present literature are:Inability provide geometric evaluation major GD&T characteristics;Lack feature aligned x, y, z direction robust single setup, tri-planar characterization;Lack variation feature size, specifically medium larger mechanical parts;No consideration effect removal base plate towards design measurement phase consideration thick base feature capable capturing base surface warping effects;Inclusion repetitive and/or redundant feature result material measurement time wastage;Artifact feature size incompatible available measurement equipment;Lack numerical simulation tool predicting geometric tolerance actual manufacturing.The solution systematically design GBTAs conduct minimal required experimentation geometric tolerance characterization purpose obtain useful data quality characterization metal process prediction purposes. “feature-based methodology” [29], link primitive geometric feature GD&T characteristics, enables straightforward systematic design used. standard ISO 17296-3 [30] outline geometric characteristic need measured, quantified, controlled define geometric property part:Size, length, angle dimensions, dimensional tolerances;Geometrical tolerancing (deviations form, orientation, position).The above-mentioned geometric characteristic standardized geometric dimensioning tolerancing (GD&T). ISO 1101: Geometrical Product Specifications [23] standard defines GD&T detail. GD&T characteristic enable systematic quantification form, location, orientation tolerance feature part. 14 GD&T characteristic ISO 1101 explained briefly along drawing symbol Table A1 Appendix A. generic guideline outlined ISO/ASTM 52902:2019 [31] test artifact design followed carefully. new GBTA quantify major GD&T characteristic tri-planar directions. Further, minimize material manufacturing time, GD&T estimation conducted using numerical simulation instead experimental GBTA fabrication characterization. Numerical simulation tool rarely used estimate GD&T and, result, reliability tool predict GD&T yet assessed. research work focused deviation simulations, residual stress simulations, microstructure simulations, topology optimization [32,33,34]. little research use macro-scale finite element simulation predict geometric tolerance LPBF part according ISO 1101 standards. Thus, along experimental datasets, framework simulation-based geometric tolerance prediction analysis also required.This article aim present new GBTA design “feature-based methodology” [29], linking primitive geometric feature GD&T characteristic quantifying major GD&T characteristic tri-planar directions. GBTA used, quantify GD&T, also ass reliability proposed methodology quantify GD&T based numerical simulation tools. aim that, future, GD&T assessed using numerical simulation proposed GBTA used model calibration verification. detailed design process explained Section 2. enables generic quality characterization LPBF process consideration GD&T perspective. corresponding experimental plan measurement procedure explained Section 3. Section 4 outline numerical simulation process, used extract deviated geometries, without base plate, virtual GD&T characterization comparison experimental results. Finally, experimental simulation result presented Section 5, followed conclusion Section 6. 2. Geometric Benchmark Test Artifact DesignThe geometric benchmark test artifact (GBTA) designed fulfill two major objectives:To perform tri-planar GD&T quantification metal process;To study effect base plate removal GD&T characteristics.To achieve first objective, major GD&T characteristic quantified range feature size GBTA. Also, feature orientation selected enable three principal planar direction tri-planar normative quantification process consideration. Given orthotropic, layer-by-layer fabrication process, coupled process physics, essential consider tri-planar repeatability mere assumption tolerance band applicability across different ax valid. feature GBTA selected according feature-based GBTA design methodology [29], give systematic guideline selecting feature according geometric tolerance characterization requirement. ability manufacture minimum feature size overhang also considered. fulfill second objective, i.e., characterize effect removing base plate, GD&T quantifier measured removing base plate.Features GBTA selected based GD&T requirement normative quantification geometric quality characteristic metal process. bounding box size GBTA decided based build volume LPBF system manufactured. Since build volume 250 × 250 × 300 mm, size GBTA base kept 200 × 200 mm feature spread surface. case LPBF, raster direction change change orientation part machine. Therefore, orientation part significant effect geometric property features. two different way variation studied characterized:Printing feature different orientation GBTA;Printing complete GBTA different orientations.The former method used study because, latter method, support structure design feature different orientation vary significantly and, result, would allow robust measurement comparison benchmark artifact samples. Therefore, GBTA used study built printing feature different orientation common base. feature present GBTA base shown Figure 1 explained below: Figure 1. Nominal GBTA design corresponding features. (Left) Top view (Right) isometric view. Cuboids: Hollow solid cuboid selected quantify straightness, flatness, perpendicularity, parallelism. Since large volume features, effect process deviation different compared small volume features, thin walls.Thin walls: Thin wall varying dimension quantify straightness, flatness, effect residual stress GD&T quantifier thin features.Cylindrical features: Solid hollow cylindrical feature placed ax three principal direction (X, Y, Z) quantify circularity cylindricity.Axially stacked cylinders: Stacked cylinder measuring concentricity runout X, Y, Z directions.Conical features: measuring circularity feature cylindrical forms.Positional features: Features positioned specified distance find positional tolerance zone features.Profile: Profile feature curve quantify profile surface line tolerance.Minimum size feature diameter external size ranging 0.5 2 mm. help check ability metal process consideration printing minimum-sized feature well effect size tolerance.Thin overhangs: Thin overhang feature understand effect support base removal thin fragile features.In addition GD&T specification geometric quantifiers, design needed take account metal process constraints. GBTA feature placed maximum area base plate covered understand spatial variations. effect variation term feature size geometric tolerance also important aspect consider, size tolerance significantly influence design metal precision applications. feature shown explained greater detail Figure A1 Table A2 Appendix B, showing numbering feature GBTA, relevant geometric tolerance features.

Numerical SimulationA numerical simulation GBTA conducted understand effect temperature stress field specific planar GD&T characteristics, well ass reliability thermo-elastic finite element model implemented Netfabb Local Simulation (Autodesk Inc., San Rafael, CA, USA) GD&T quantification [38]. First, part support structure imported Netfabb Local Simulation. Then, process parameter file (PRM) generated conducting micro-scale simulation using experimental parameter SS 316L material. process parameter used used experimental study described Table 2. simulation parameter shown Table 4. temperature-dependent material property SS 316L based data References [39,40]. PRM file used conduct macroscale simulation GBTA part [41,42]. boundary condition macroscale model follows: Table 4. Simulation parameters. Mechanical boundary conditions: bottom node base plate fixed, i.e., zero displacement imposed directions. boundaries, zero normal stress boundary condition used.Thermal boundary conditions: convective heat transfer boundary condition considered powder environment. heat loss coefficient value 20 W/m2/K used [43].The input STL, along supports, shown Figure 5a meshing strategy shown Figure 5b. solution obtained, predicted displacement field used construct deviated GBTA part. deviated STL file imported GOM Inspect (GOM GmBH, Braunschweig, Germany) [44] extracting GD&T quantifier one-to-one comparison experimental results.

Results DiscussionThe measurement data experiment predicted deformed geometry simulation used extract GD&T characteristic presented following sections. data sample removing base plate also presented comparative analysis discussion. 5.1. Form Tolerances 5.1.1. StraightnessThe straightness tolerance zone computed feature categorized according feature’s orientation reference planes—XY, YZ, ZX. Results feature parallel reference plane XY shown bar labeled “XY” Figure 7. similar approach used YZ ZX. experimental measurements, sample space contained 13 feature feature axis aligning XY plane 8 YZ ZX planes. example, first XY bar Figure 7 show experimental result average tolerance zone 13 feature aligned XY plane base plate intact GBTA. Figure 7. Straightness tolerance result (μm), without base plate. Experimental result showed straightness tolerance anisotropic respect reference plane since result different three principal planar directions, along variation standard deviation. straightness tolerance higher XY planar direction measurement performed as-built part without post-processing; therefore, hatching effect cannot ignored plane. effect increased chessboard (or checkerboard) style hatching, laser movement multi-directional creates crisscross waviness surface. hatching effect maximum surface parallel XY plane plane laser moved part built. general, straightness tolerance result increased 15 20 µm three planar direction removal base plate, anticipated residual stress released base plate removal, which, turn, increased deviations. Even larger curvature base feature GBTA removal base plate, form tolerances, straightness, le affected, independent datums. largest straightness tolerance zone observed thin sheet (feature 9) XY plane. 158 µm base plate 183 µm without base plate. large tolerance zone resulted due low thickness value, i.e., 500 µm, sheet, led larger deformation rapid cooling part throughout process.Figure 7 show predicted straightness tolerance numerical simulations. simulation result closely followed experimental result YZ plane; however, dip simulation result XY plane, could hatching phenomenon properly captured simulations. three directions, overall tolerance band 40 µm lower (with without base plate) result follows pattern. hypothesized reason major variation straightness tolerance XY plane surface waviness due hatching captured well simulations. difference result similar range generic surface waviness value LPBF-manufactured SS 316L part [5]. difference experimental result YZ ZX plane also completely captured simulations. Since straightness form tolerance boundary condition maximum effect form tolerances, “uniform heat loss condition” could one reason similarity simulation result YZ ZX planes. However, standard deviation XY plane almost experimental numerical results, without base plate, i.e., ±1 µm. 5.1.2. FlatnessThe sample space flatness tolerance contained 20 feature XY plane, 25 feature YZ plane, 24 feature ZX plane. flatness result experiment simulation shown Figure 8, comparison without base plate removal. Much like straightness results, anisotropy experimental result observed flatness tolerance well. largest tolerance band without base plate observed XY plane smallest YZ plane. Maximum tolerance band observed XY plane without base plate conditions. XY plane building plane, also bore effect in-plane shrinkage building part. Further, release residual stress removal base plate also affected XY plane highest degree base feature GBTA parallel XY plane, feature mounted. Since flatness tolerance spread complete region feature, even minor curvature warpage due removal base plate affected tolerance zone. large standard deviation result ZX plane without base plate observed, i.e., standard deviation 56 µm. could due recoater direction, perpendicular ZX plane affected layer edge building, hence reducing surface quality ZX walls. Figure 8. Flatness tolerance result (μm) without base plate. Looking simulation result Figure 8, overall lower range flatness tolerance observed compared experimental results, except YZ plane. experiment simulations, standard deviation result increased removal base plate. show removal base plate, surface warped greater extent, leading rise standard deviation. instance, feature 4, 5, 18, 19 show approximate increase 20 µm flatness XY plane removal base plate closer edge affected warpage GBTA base feature. interesting result notice standard deviation ZX plane base plate, reduces 26 µm 16 µm. possible reasoning behind could feature larger flatness tolerance band experienced warpage way base plate removal flatness value dropped. 5.1.3. CircularityMeasurements done different cylindrical conical feature ax aligned respective reference axial directions—X, Y, Z. tolerance zone computed category features, represented bar chart Figure 9. sample space contained six feature X ax direction 26 feature Z-axis direction. larger number feature Z direction varied term size volume get detailed account circularity variation principal build axis, i.e., Z-axis. Figure 9. Circularity (μm) tolerance results, without base plate. experimental results, circularity tolerance zone base plate intact around 104 µm three axial directions. However, standard deviation highest Z-axis, i.e., 40 µm, without base plate, standard deviation increased 52 µm. large standard deviation observed Z-axis due removal base plate large number feature characterized Z-axis direction. However, since circularity measured feature revolutions, change diametric value feature also correlated circularity tolerance. Trends circularity vs. diameter Z-axis direction shown Figure 10. Similar result observed experimental circularity tolerance removal base plate. Figure 10. Diameter vs. circularity (experimental). circularity base plate, clear relationship observed, i.e., circularity tolerance zone increased increase diameter. also depicted linear trend line R-squared coefficient value 0.8272. However, circularity result removing base plate, particular trend observed. reasonable explanation uneven distribution residual stress led variation deviation. Since change diameter, surface area feature changed, led change residual stress resulting deviation tolerance zone.In simulation results, overall mean shift around 40 µm observed direction result without base plate. major reason mean shift could generic under-prediction observed deviation simulation inability simulation capture meso-level surface variations. Apart mean shift low standard deviation, simulation result followed similar trend experimental results, especially result removal base plate. 5.1.4. CylindricityCylindricity tolerance result shown Figure 11. sample space contained six feature X direction 25 feature Z direction. diameter cylindrical feature varied 0.5 mm 30 mm. Unlike circularity, directional result removal base plate similar range three principal axial directions. result axial direction X showed highest peak experimental cylindricity tolerance zone, well standard deviation hike. One reason huge variation large support structures, decreased dimensional fidelity features, along residual stress release, another reason could cantilever effect due nature geometric form feature [45]. effect diameter also studied cylindricity tolerance zones, result shown Figure 12. linear trend observed cylindricity tolerance zone, get wider increase diameter cylindrical feature. Even outlier small diameter features, set result (with without base plate) showed similar trend. trendline (with base plate) R-squared coefficient value 0.7734, trendline (without base plate) R-squared coefficient value 0.5607. result without base plate offset additional 40–50 µm. Figure 11. Cylindricity (μm) tolerance results, without base plate. Figure 12. Diameter vs. cylindricity (experimental). Simulation result cylindricity base plate intact close experimental results. Unlike large rise cylindricity observed X-axis direction experimental result without base plate, simulation show anomaly. could surface defect induced removal support structure captured simulations. Moreover, rise cylindricity feature X direction (such feature 2, 3, 6) still observed simulation results, similar experimental results, due removal base plate support structures. However, rise cylindricity tolerance removal base plate still lower side compared tolerance increase seen form tolerances. cylindricity tolerance based form cylindrical feature, orientation, removal base plate, maximum effect seen orientation compared form cylindrical features.Overall, analysis result form tolerance show general increase tolerance zone GBTA removed base plate. directly linked release residual stress within GBTA. Additionally, increase standard deviation suggests similar reason. Apart this, process parameter laser-material interaction significant effect, become clearer result analyzed set process parametric variations. now, stated selected process parameter SS 316L material, form tolerance generally range 50 130 µm exceptions, spike cylindricity X-axis direction removal base plate. 5.2. Orientation Tolerances 5.2.1. PerpendicularityThe GBTA contained 16 feature XY plane 18 feature YZ ZX plane perpendicularity measured. perpendicularity tolerance zone result shown Figure 13. experimental perpendicularity, standard deviation increased factor two base plate removed. increased 54 µm 24 µm. maximum experimental tolerance band observed XY plane. simulation result perpendicularity close experimental result exceptions. major variation consistently observed perpendicularity result perpendicularity minimum YZ plane experimental results, simulation result ZX plane. addition, simulation result YZ plane higher experimental results, usual case tolerance characterization simulation results. Since perpendicularity orientation tolerance, flatness datum plane affected tolerance zone, seen experiment simulations. variation flatness datum plane also propagated tolerance zone perpendicularity results. could major reason inconsistency variation results. Figure 13. Perpendicularity (μm) tolerance results, without base plate. 5.2.2. ParallelismThe sample space parallelism tolerance contained 15 feature XY plane 13 feature YZ ZX planes. Parallelism result experiment simulation shown Figure 14. experimental result show anticipated increase tolerance zone removal base plate. standard deviation value different planar direction, average standard deviation three plane remained similar without base plate results. result base plate XY YZ comparable; however, rise around 20 µm ZX plane. result without base plate show highest average tolerance zone 215 µm YZ plane. general, small-sized feature showed larger parallelism tolerance zone base plate intact. However, removing base plate, tolerance zone variation small feature le tolerance zone variation large features. increase average tolerance zone removing base plate due mainly larger size feature susceptible warpage deformation release stress. simulation result showed similar trend variation planes, especially result base plate. planar variation follows trend highest ZX plane tolerance zone similar standard deviation. However, zone 36 µm smaller experimental results. variation observed result without base plate. addition, standard deviation result without base plate increase 14 µm experimental simulation results. Figure 14. Parallelism (μm) tolerance results, without base plate. 5.2.3. AngularityAngularity measurement done two planar feature 40-degree angle XY plane shown Figure 15. experimental angularity increased removing base plate. simulations, rise tolerance zone removal base plate similar 3 µm. However, average tolerance zone higher 8 µm, i.e., 91 µm base plate compared 83 µm experimental value. Figure 15. Angularity (μm) tolerance results, without base plate. 5.3. Location Tolerances 5.3.1. ConcentricityConcentricity tolerance important location tolerance deciding location one cylindrical feature respect another play major role assembly operations. concentricity result shown Figure 16. Experimental concentricity result base plate intact without base plate follow similar trend maximum tolerance zone Y-axis minimum Z-axis. worth noting among GD&T characteristic discussed above, concentricity largest tolerance zones. due composite nature concentricity tolerance, also depends form cylinder axial shift cylindrical feature respect other. Even two feature per axis three measurement per feature, standard deviation large. simulation result also follow suit average concentricity tolerance highest along Y-axis minimum along Z-axis increase tolerance zone removal base plate. standard deviation simulation result closely followed experimental results. Figure 16. Concentricity (μm) tolerance results, without base plate. 5.3.2. PositionThe GBTA feature positioned evenly base study position tolerance planar axial position result shown Figure 17. planar position variation highest YZ plane results. YZ plane perpendicular recoater direction recoater movement powder spread could significant reason large tolerance zones. similar trend observed simulation simulation solver also considered recoater direction recoater interference. standard deviation also got wider YZ planar direction result along rise tolerance zone. axial position tolerance, cylindrical feature used across entire GBTA result shown Figure 18. experimental simulation result consistent term variation across axes. axial position, Y-axis tolerance zone highest experimental simulation results. Simulation result underpredicted position tolerance planar axial features. standard deviation much higher standard deviation observed GD&T characteristics, tolerance value quite bit higher tolerance characteristic positional features. exact reasoning behind significant shift still unknown, logical reason recoater direction effect micro-mirror orientation governing laser beam. Figure 17. Position tolerance (planar) result (µm), without base plate. Figure 18. Position tolerance (axial) result (µm), without base plate. 5.4. Runout TolerancesCircular runout total runout tolerance result experiment simulation shown Figure 19 Figure 20, respectively. Circular runout, theory, precise way measuring circularity considers point periphery circular feature measured. almost circular runout tolerance zone shown Figure 19 50–100 µm respective circularity tolerance result (Figure 9). average tolerance band experimental circular runout 197 µm base plate intact. removal base plate, average value reached 217 µm. standard deviation also increased 99 µm 109 µm. maximum runout observed Y-axis features, trend observed simulation results. However, simulation result circular runout showed downward mean shift around 10 µm average tolerance value standard deviation also reduced least 30 µm. average change mostly due drop value direction X axes. experimental results, due removal base plate, surface defect come play, case simulations. effect significant total runout results, considers complete feature, effect diminishes compared tolerance zone complete feature. shown Figure 20, result total runout quite bit higher circular runout even higher concentricity result except Y-axis features. Figure 19. Circular runout (μm) tolerance results, without base plate. Figure 20. Total runout (μm) tolerance results, without base plate. total runout, experimental simulation result quite similar without base plate results, i.e., 214 µm 224 µm, respectively. standard deviation increased 21 µm 26 µm. Similarly, simulation results, average tolerance value increased 214 µm 219 µm standard deviation value rose 18 µm 25 µm. trend similar trend observed circular runout concentricity major reason support removal warpage due residual stresses. 6.

IntroductionFerritic stainless steel (SS)-430 Fe-Cr based alloy body centred cubic crystal structure. element chromium (Cr) alloy added range 11–30%. alloy exhibit good formability ductility, however, exhibit relatively poor mechanical property high temperature compared austenite grade stainless steel. high heat conduction, low thermal expansion, good resistance stress corrosion important characteristic related ferritic stainless steel [Citation1]. extensively utilized manufacturing furnace parts, heat exchangers, protection tubes, electrical appliances, storage vessels, oil burner parts, petrochemical refining equipment, household appliances, solar water heater [Citation2,Citation3]. joining steel main requirement assemble complex configuration well many structural applications. Fusion-based joining process [gas metal arc welding (GMAW), tungsten inert welding (TIG), shielded metal arc welding (SMAW)] friction welding mostly used fabrication SS-430 SS-430 weldment. process exhibit certain kind advantage limitation respect particular application. fusion welding process cause coarsening grain heat-affected zone (HAZ) detrimental toughness fabricated weldment. issue related fusion-based joining process grain boundary carbide formation sigma phase fusion zone (FZ) HAZ fabricated weldment. issue significant negative impact mechanical characteristic (toughness, ductility, elevated temperature strength) corrosion resistance fabricated weldment. problem grain coarsening effect overcome using various method like low heat input process friction welding [Citation4,Citation5], usage pulsed power TIG welding [Citation6], addition interstitial element improve grain size precipitates, etc. [Citation6]. Sathiya et al. [Citation4] reported friction welding SS-430 weldment. author reported fabricated weldment exhibit 95% property base metal (BM). However, unsymmetrical configuration material cannot joined using friction welding process. Mohandas Reddy [Citation6] reported effect SMAW TIG fabrication SS-430 weldment using stabilizing element like copper (Cu) titanium (Ti). author reported TIG welding lead superior mechanical property compared SMAW due low heat input associated TIG welding process. literature, found limited work reported fusion joining SS-430 weldment. Further, always need join material novel technique le costly eco-friendly. Recently, lot work reported process material using novel microwave technique. Microwave heating applied directly process material good absorber microwave room temperature like polymers, ceramics, composite [Citation7]. processing metal-based material room temperature using microwave challenging task metal conductor reflect microwave room temperature due presence electron cloud [Citation7]. Therefore, bulk metal treated using hybrid microwave heating (MH) approach suitable susceptor utilized joining bulk metallic materials. susceptor material (SiC charcoal) quickly absorbs microwave room temperature heated high temperatures. Afterwards, susceptor heat metal-based material processed conventional way increase skin depth material cause microwave couple material atomic molecular level generate heat inside them. hybrid MH joining metal-based material advanced type fusion joining process. microwave interaction material, dipole rotation ionic conduction atomic molecular level transform electromagnetic energy within material heat energy. Therefore, energy conversion rather energy transfer generally dominates conventional heating material [Citation7]. unique heating phenomenon several built-in characteristics, including uniform volumetric heating, result reduction residual stress set inside material enhanced product quality [Citation7]. Recently, lot work employing hybrid MH approach described joining metal-based material [Citation7,Citation8]. researcher reported hybrid MH induced weldment exhibit better metallurgical bonding complete melting sandwich filler layer. fabricated weldment exhibit better mechanical properties. reported size filler metal play important role fabricated joint properties. small-size filler layer-based fabricated weldment exhibit better mechanical property micron-size filler-based weldment fabricated hybrid MH approach [Citation9]. nano filler layer resulted increment mechanical, physical, metallurgical property fabricated weldment nano-based filler layer better interaction microwave micron size powder due increased skin depth larger surface area [Citation9]. Somani et al. [Citation10] described microwave-induced butt joining SS-430 Ni-based alloy powder. fabricated weldment reveals 471 MPa tensile strength 9.02% elongation, according author’s findings. Sahota et al. [Citation11] reported impact binding agent using two distinct filler metal (Ni-based EWAC SS-316L) joint characteristic microwave induced SS-430 weldment. author reported SS-316L based filler metal exhibit better mechanical property chemical composition matching near matching BM welded. discussion, found selection filler material play important role property fabricated weldment act main binding agent BM joined. present work, SS-430 SS-430 butt joint fabricated using nano-based SS-316L powder filler material. fabricated weldment subjected various mechanical metallurgical characterizations.2.

IntroductionLaser-based directed energy deposition (DED) additive manufacturing (AM) technology produce geometrically complex component directly feeding wire powder [1]. addition metal alloys, DED offer great potential create metal matrix composite (MMCs) [2]. majority MMCs produced powder-fed DED, yet still limitation process, low deposition rate, powder segregation, low capture rate, bad surface finish, etc. [3], [4]. Alternatively, wire-fed DED utilizes tubular cored wire, consisting pure metal sheath reinforcing particle inside tube, fabricate MMC part high deposition rate [5], [6]. Compared powder-fed mode, wire-fed DED process MMCs limited coarse microstructure, high residual stress, low dimensional accuracy [7]. offset shortcoming caused single-filler-fed DED, coincident wire-powder fed DED (WP-DED) process utilized build high-performance MMC component [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13].During WP-DED process, metal alloy wire reinforcing particle simultaneously fed respective nozzles. Lateral wire-powder feeding well lateral wire coaxial powder feeding two existing method WP-DED process [14], [15], [16]. fraction reinforcing particle easily determined adjusting wire powder feeding rate [8]. several study WP-DED various MMCs, e.g., Ti6Al4V/TiC [8], Ti6Al4V/WC [9], [10], Inconel 625/WC [11], Ni/Cu [12], Al 6061/WC [13]. process parameter indeed affect microstructure property final parts. instance, Farayibi [9] fabricates Ti6Al4V/WC composite WP-DED process. increase laser power alleviates W solid solution precipitation β-stabilized Ti matrix. retained W benefit maintaining ductility Ti matrix. Abioye [11] discovers volume fraction WC/W2C Inconel 625/WC-W2C composite decreased laser power, traverse speed, wire feed rate, finally deteriorating corrosion performance as-built parts. addition, feeding direction either wire powder significant influence deposition rate surface finish as-built parts.

Moreover, suitable additive chosen, reduction sintering temperature also possible [5].While metal metal alloy meet many biomechanical requirement orthopedic implants, interfacial bonding metallic surface surrounding bone poor non-existent [2–5]. Thus analysis alloy provides convincing evidence failure originates implant-tissue interface [6, 7]. One common approach alleviate problem use calcium phosphate, CaP coating implant surfaces. past decade, calcium phosphate based ceramic used many medical, orthopedic, dental application [8–13]. CaP material hydroxyapatite (HA), Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2, HA, attracted considerable attention close resemblance chemical mineral component teeth bone. result similarity HA show good biocompatibility bone [14, 15], led use bioactive tissue bonding materials.Deposition calcium phosphate coating implant material made various methods, hot isostatic pressing, plasma flame spraying, ion-beam sputter deposition, electrophoretic deposition, radio-frequency (RF), magnetron sputtering sol–gel deposition [16–18]. Plasma spraying well understood common usage commercial aspects, control variable quite complicated. Furthermore extremely high temperature (10,000–30,000 °C) used process vastly affect property final coating result potentially serious problems. associated problem plasma spray method addressed [19]. problem summarized as; substantial structural change coating substrate material, vastly affect property final coatings, internal cavities, difficulty porous coating due line-of-sight process, lack repeatability homogeneity.Hydroxyapatite coating used cementless bioactive fixation provide enhanced quality bone apposition rate fixation long term prosthesis [20]. However, vivo experiment showed instability particulate debris reaction bone/coating/implant interface, reduce efficiency long term. failure may associated coating thickness, well chemical physical property [21, 22]. work dealt synthesizing homemade hydroxyapatite powder [23–25] using novel synthetic body fluid solution via self-propagating combustion method using sol–gel ceramic coating Ti alloy substrate 840 °C sintering temperature. citric acid combustion method also adapted synthesize nanocrystalline HA powder throughout sol–gel [26]. Flexural strength structural property reported work. Milella et al. [27] achieved bioceramic composite coating pure titanium substrate using dip-coating technique. Cameron et al. suggested aging process HA sol–gel solution coating [28]. HA coating Ti6Al4V substrate prepared sol–gel method [29]. P2O5 solution used 14 MPa bonding strength reported. another work HA coated onto Ti substrate insertion titanium (TiO2) buffer layer sol–gel method. biomimetic approach one possible route obtain calcium phosphate coating metallic implants. simple rapid heating method successfully developed calcium phosphate coating Ti6Al4V deposited using sol–gel derived precursor [30]. Liu et al. [31] developed water based sol–gel technique coating 316L stainless steel was, reported despite surface crack occurred high bonding strength achieved. help SBF-A solution biomimetic bioreactor, thin uniform amorphous calcium phosphate coating deposited Ti6Al4V tantalum cylinder [32]. Costa Maquis [33] used surfactant acting hydrophobic substrate seashell source calcium. work retain HA crystallization SBF solution used immersion substrates. Sol–gel deposition HA already processed form film polymerization route presented work [34–37].However, relation dip coating sol–gel process, work interested producing homemade precursors, and/or none work dealt high production rate finding optimum sintering characteristics, biomechanical changes, surface analysis whole common substrates. strongly believed producing high amount HA ceramic powder research lab using large scale repeated deposition process hard task time consuming.In work, thought using commercially supplied crystallized HA powders, together sol–gel chemical additive enables process repeatability high coating speed low temperature coupling high production rates. bioceramic films, thick 15–20 μm, deposited 316L Ti6Al4V alloy using sol–gel process achieve fast homogeneous coating adequate bonding achieved. this, sol–gel route planned maintain mechanical property substrate. surface morphology SEM XRD pattern evaluated hardness, bonding stress determined respect sintering temperatures.2 Experimental procedureA sol–gel process applied controlled dipping withdrawal rate varying coating thickness. involves simply preparing adequate sol suspension mixing HA Ethanol (99.5%) 250 mL grinding jar milling 4 h. fine homogenized ceramic sol–gel achieved using biocompatible chemical P2O5, Ca2CO3, NaCO3, small amount KH2PO4. dipping system apparatus designed manufactured (Fig. 1) allowing substrate withdrawn adjustable rates. method benefit simplicity, low cost, ease control reduced sintering temperature due small particle size also additives, ability homogeneous smooth coating, long large orthopedic implant good coverage consistency. prepared sol–gel suspension flow chart process tabulated Fig. 2. process common implant pedicle, intramadular, interference, hip prosthesis, easily coated large scale varying capacity dipping container.

Therefore work coating thickness kept le 25 μm average. bonding strengths, general, appeared lower Ti6Al4V substrates, much lower (10–14 Mpa) thicker coating (25–40 μm) average bonding strength 17.5 MPa thin thick coatings. obtained bonding strength coatings, 15 20 MPa, high enough keep coated inorganic material substrate without peeling implantation also could provide good fixation bone implant. proven previous vivo work [1, 4]. reported there, see indication peeling insertion process coated screws. relatively good bonding surface feature underlying substrate obtained current dipping method, especially interesting term sintering temperature low 750 °C. However must emphasized long term vivo test necessary show degradability ceramic coatings, next task.The Vickers hardness value coated sintered surface shown Fig. 4 various sintering temperature 675, 750, 800 850 °C. seen figure, initial increase followed decrease increasing sintering temperature. always desirable lower sintering temperature low possible, high sintering temperature cause significant phase change microstructure substrate lower mechanical properties. Ti6Al4V α–β transition temperature 880 °C associated significant volume change may cause surface crack substrate. Therefore sintering temperature throughout work kept 880 °C. result seen minimum hardness value obtained 675 °C despite 750 800 °C hardness value appeared close other, maximum hardness achieved 750 °C sintering temperature, therefore used optimum working temperature. concluded figure that; bonding tensile strength increase increasing hardness reach maximum temperature 750 °C.Figures 5 6 show XRD pattern coating sintering various temperature 675, 750, 800 850 °C. seen figs, peak seen 20 50° 2θ, represent characteristic peak apatitic phase also TCP according JCPDS card peak slightly change increasing sintering temperature. intensity increase, however, substrate 316L sintering temperature 850 °C change becomes noticeable due high crystallization rate high temperatures. XRD pattern different sintering temperature showed broad peak corresponding HA reflection, strongest peak appeared 30–35° 2θ angles. peak kept position along 2θ angle intensity increased sintering temperature increased.SEM micrographs coated surface morphology shown Fig. 7a–d. Fig. 7a due low sintering temperature coating material-HA appeared sintered all. However Fig. 6b increasing temperature (750 °C) coating give better interconnected bonding denser structure. Fig. 6c although bonding HA powder showed good connection powder seen lower densification. Although (Fig. 7d) show lower bonding densification comparison others.

Better densification interconnection powder particle obtained 316L substrate comparison Ti6Al4V. reason may due similarity substrate e.g., SS additive 316L powder may cause gel composition similar substrate make sintering easier, resulting better mechanical properties.Figure 9a, b show SEM micrographs surface film Ti6Al4V SS substrates. intersection seen (a) HA coating layer substrate, vertical cross-section 10–20 μm coating layer present. SEM micrographs showed hydroxyapatite layer uniformly deposited relatively high bonding implant materials. higher magnification coating surface showed crack due shrinkage occurring drying thermal process (Fig. 10). Despite reported could supply point “mechanical interlocking” [14] promoting osteointegration; work, unfortunately contrary, case. thick coatings, especially (>40 μm), exhibited severe surface crack (Fig. 9) sometimes drying, mostly seen sintering processes, even though sintered 750 °C. overcome problem, thinner coating and/or inorganic, biocompatible additive amount phosphor pentha oxide glycerol determined added sols. Furthermore multiple coating also considered may reduce eliminate surface crack [38]. However, long term degradation coating currently continuing work result submitted published soon.Statistically, analysis variance analysis (ANOVA) provides decision confidence level whether process parameter significantly different [39]. Larger F-values indicate variation process parameter make significant change tensile bonding strength (TBS). result ANOVA process presented Table 1 2, TBS hardness, respectively. seen table sintering temperature effective parameter mechanical property coating. current analysis also showed experimental error low (0.2 4.09%) reliability limit found 99% bonding 95% hardness. Table 1 ANOVA variant analysis bondingFull size table Table 2 ANOVA variant analysis hardnessFull size table Despite indicated dip coating would produce rough surface [38], fact, depending upon particle size powder added gelation material qualities, dipping method appears producing good acceptable homogenous surfaces. However repeatability quality coating manipulated careful treating process parameter bonding strength also improved sintering additives. work experienced shown that, use sol–gel dip coating method deposition bioceramic HA coating simple, good flexibility using various shape medical implant material homogeneous smooth coating surface high production rates, comparison processing alternatives. work may require show variation bonding coating thickness, shape change also application process long term vivo applications, fact, next task take place.4 ConclusionsCheap, easy, repeatable high production rate bioceramic coating Ti6Al4V 316L SS implant material achieved using dipping method. Among various sintering temperature tested; surface properties, hardness bonding strength showed better property 750 °C.

IntroductionHydroxyapatite (HA) ceramic material similar chemical structure human bone teeth (Lemons, 1988, Martinetti et al., 2004). Owing excellent biocompatibility, extensively used many prosthetic application improve direct contact bone-implants ultimately minimize healing time (Gan Pilliar, 2004, Porter et al., 2002). However, mechanical property inferior natural bone, restricts use high load bearing clinical application (Salih et al., 2001, Kim et al., 2004). sintered HA posse bending strength (115–200 MPa) (Hench, 1998) nearly match strength cortical bone (50–150 MPa) (Van Audekercke Martens, 1984), whereas fracture toughness (1.0 MPa m1/2) (Hench, 1998) far le cortical bone (2–12 MPa m1/2) (Van Audekercke Martens, 1984). Presently, hydroxyapatite deposited bio metallic material coating help suppress release harmful metallic ion (Cook et al., 1992). Further, many effort made improve mechanical property HA coating adding secondary phase pure HA yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) (Yugeswaran et al., 2012), alumina (Al2O3), titania (Singh et al., 2011, Melero et al., 2014, Perumal et al., 2014), silica (SiO2) (Morks, 2008), carbon nanotube (CNTs) (Balani et al., 2007). Moreover, bonding strength enhanced introducing intermediate layer (bond coat) HA top coat substrate (Chou Chang, 2002, Chou Chang, 2002, Li et al., 2009). Since zirconia (ZrO2) well-known bio inert ceramic high strength, therefore used many researcher develop bond coat (Chou Chang, 2002, Chou Chang, 2002, Chou Chang, 2003) improve mechanical properties.Several coating technique used deposit HA coatings, including electrophoretic deposition, ion beam sputtering, high velocity oxyfuel deposition, micro arc oxidation, pulsed laser deposition (Sridhar et al., 2003, Wang et al., 2001, Li et al., 2002a, Chen et al., 2006, Khandelwala et al., 2013). However, vacuum plasma spraying (VPS), technique clinically approved Food Drug Administration (FDA), USA (Balani et al., 2007) since produce controlled coating better uniformity density comparison coating methods. contrast VPS process involves extreme heating sudden cooling led formation secondary phase (e.g. α/β tricalcium phosphate, tetracalcium phosphate, oxyhydroxyapatite, amorphous calcium phosphate) (Gledhill et al., 2001). metastable phase greatly affect mechanical biological behaviour coating high dissolution rate phase aqueous environments. One way solve problem adopt appropriate post coating heat treatment help improve phase purity, porosity crystallinity coating system (Lee et al., 2005, Chen Ding, 2006). Besides post coating heat treatment lead higher adhesive strength mechanical stability (Yang et al., 2006).Therefore, review pertinent literature observed study concerned deposition HA coating biomaterials using plasma spray technique; relatively study performed vacuum plasma spray technique. VPS technique added advantage producing coating greater uniformity high density comparison plasma spray processes. Hence, paper two reinforced HA coating (HA – 10 wt% Al2O3 HA – 10 wt% ZrO2) deposited intermediate layer zirconia SS 316 L using VPS technique. Coatings microstructural mechanical property investigated. influence post coating heat treatment (at 700 °C 1 h air atmosphere) property also investigated.2. Materials methods2.1.

Surface roughnessSurface roughness great impact mechanical biological performance HA coating observed various researcher past (Wang et al., 1995, Mohammadi et al., 2007). degree osseointegration improved using rough highly crystalline HA coating observed Aebli et al. (2003) biological testing. hand also published previous literature (Gledhill et al., 2001) surface roughness increase correspondingly dissolution rate HA coating increase since larger area coating exposed body fluid environment. Hence appropriate balance level surface roughness must sustained.

PorosityPorosity play great role biological performance HA coating allows bone in-growth thus helping implant fixation. However, long term stability HA coating high porosity body fluid environment doubtful. Furthermore, high porosity level negative impact mechanical properties, especially bond strength shear strength, since offer easy fracture path failures. Therefore, imply porosity level HA coating must well balanced achieve optimised level mechanical biological performance.Percentage porosity coating heat treatment given Table 4.

Similar result found recent study (Singh et al., 2017a, Singh et al., 2017b).3.5.2. Bond strengthThe overall success HA coating decided mechanical property (Pichugin et al., 2008). Among various mechanical properties, bond strength important based various parameter phase chemical composition, crystallinity porosity deposited coating (Surmenev, 2012). effect heat treatment bond strength shown Fig. 10. evident bond strength coating improved post coating heat treatment. Considerable improvement bond strength observed SHAA coating (~48%) compared SHAZ coating (~15%), heat treatment. improvement bond strength reliable variation observed crystallinity porosity heat treatment (see Table 4). could proposed conversion non-apatite phase crystalline HA proved beneficial improvement bond strength HA coating (Li et al., 2002b). Also, stated previous literature (Gross et al., 1998) amount amorphous phase near interface higher across thickness coating due low thermal diffusivity HA. assumed crystallization foreign phase, present near interface positive effect bond strength deposited coating (Li et al., 2002b).

IntroductionSurface modification effective method, provides enriched change material surfaces. Coating one technique different material deposited surface, improves property hardness, roughness wear resistance [1]. biocompatibility long term implant material refers ability device carry anticipated function, desired level incorporation system [2].Stainless steel (SS) 316L better corrosion resistance, due oxide film formation surface. widely used orthopedic implant injured broken bones, joint considering biocompatible property [3]. Though favorable feature employed alternative material implants, surface hardness poor. Hence, adequate resist surface wear sliding environment [4], [5]. Titanium (Ti) alloy commonly used implant material, due low density, high specific strength, non-toxicity excellent corrosion resistance [6]. SS 316L high density 8.3 g/cm3 compared Titanium alloy graded Ti–6Al–4V 4.5 g/cm3, low cost hand material. SS 316L Nickel content 8%, act pitting corrosion [4], [5]. Nickel release due friction would cause letdown biocompatibility bio-functionality SS 316L [4]. oxide film chromium protects surface wear environment SS 316L. Hence, significant improve wear resistance prevent nickel release [7]. Wear loss material limit performance life implants. one type failure made surface contact; hence, surface modification required improve wear resistance, implant active better performance [8].Ti–6Al–4V anticorrosive bio-compatible material low density. oxide layer formation Ti surface resists wear contact surface [9]. Different coating performed Ti–6Al–4V, adhesion strength coating improved, affording enhanced mechanical tribological property [10]. concluded Ti–6Al–4V alloy exhibit good tribological properties, low friction coefficient high wear resistance Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMW-PE) coating [11]. Plasma Nitrided austenitic steel graded SS 316LN rings, exhibit excellent wear resistance SS 316LN pin Colmonoy pin temperature [12]. AISI 316L stainless steel (SS) implanted N2, TiN Zr, PVD coated TiN Tinalox, consequently Tinalox coated specimens, exhibited best performance via le worn surfaces, harder nitride [13].Coating process good adhesion strength, interface substrate bulk material, uniformity surface, improved morphological properties. TiN coating higher mass uptake compared TiNbN TiCN coatings. Titanium nitride coated AISI 1020 steel disc, hardness 1450 VHN, lesser wear rate TiN coated steel ball compared hardened steel ball. wear rate increase increased load decrease hardness [14]. Higher hardness better adhesion achieved depositing titanium nitride (TiN) steel surface, Cathodic Arc Deposition (CAD) coating techniques, due high ionization rate vapor particle energy. Cathodic arc deposition provides protective hard dense coating columnar microstructure due arc ion direction normal surface cathode [15].The wear test result SS 316L (N) demonstrate higher wear rate, increased frictional force widened wear tracks, occurred elevated temperature [16]. bearing material improved surface hardness wear resistance HVOF powder spray coating [17].The wear result optimized Response Surface Methodology (RSM); this, relationship input output variable experiment determined using modeling techniques. RSM blending statistical mathematical model tool developing optimizing process parameter [18]. RSM become common practice engineering problems, used extensively characterization problems, input variable influence performance output variables. RSM provides quantitative measurement possible interaction factors, difficult obtain using optimization techniques. author investigated application RSM optimization process characteristic [19]. RSM right procedure deal response influenced multi-variables. method significantly reduces number trial required respond model [20].There limited work attempted concern wear behavior TiN deposited surface also reported detail. present study, wear test conducted TiN deposited SS 316L Titanium Alloy (Ti–6Al–4V) different modified process parameters. wear mechanism ball-on-disc wear tester similar artificial hip prosthesis, sliding contact acetabular cup femoral head.

IntroductionStress corrosion cracking (SCC) one critical environmental-assisted degradation issue 316L austenitic stainless steel (SS) boiling water reactor (BWR) [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]]. traditional way suppress SCC susceptibility, hydrogen often injected cooling water reduce oxidants, oxygen hydrogen perioxides [2,[5], [6], [7], [8], [9]]. reduction efficacy extended aid noble metal chemical addition technique [10], also lessened dissolved-hydrogen (DH) requirement several hundred several ten ppb level keeping corrosion potential low levels.The effect DH SCC SSs hot water attracted great attention variety study done far. researcher measured crack growth rate (CGR) pre-cracked compact tension (CT) specimens, others used slow strain rate test (SSRT) flat humped tensile specimens. study adopted former method, reported hydrogen injection suppressed SCC growth rate solution-annealed cold-worked 316L SS [11,12]. considered dissolved hydrogen water reduced oxidation reaction crack-tip alleviated crack growth process. However, limited research addressed effect hydrogen SCC nucleation process.Among study adopted latter method, Arioka et al. [3] tested solution-annealed 316 SS simulated PWR primary water condition. found minimum CGR within DH content ranging 0 45 cc/kg. number work non-sensitized cold-worked 316L SS slightly different Arioka's results. instance, Zhong et al. [13] reported maximum CGR DH = 15 cc/kg 320 °C, use hollowed cylindrical 316 SS tube cold-worked condition. Choi [14] reported that, 340 °C, CGR increased DH content as-received 316 L SS. Furutani et al. [15] reported that, irradiation-assisted SCC susceptibility increased DH content 30 cc/kg 320 °C, specimen irradiated 5 × 1026 n/m2 (E > 0.1 MeV). fracture mode also different among researchers. Arioka's group reported intergranular (IG) crack initiation transgranular (TG) crack propagation specimen tested DH = 30 cc/kg 320 °C. Meanwhile, Nono et al. [16] showed TGSCC solution-annealed 316L SS DH = 0.4 ppm 288 °C.In general, dissolved hydrogen diminishes concentration excess oxidant hot water consequently reduces metal-oxidant reaction (anodic reaction) rate corrosion potential measure degree corrosion aggressiveness. Despite understandings, relevant issue cathodic reaction exchange current density never often discussed. Qiu et al. [17] measured electrochemical behavior Alloy 600 simulated pressurized water environment, showed DH increased exchange current density consequently elevated cathodic reaction rate corrosion potential decreased.On hand, hydrogen-assisted degradation widely known hydrogen-induced cracking (HIC) hydrogen embrittlement gaseous environment. Caskey [18] conducted tensile test 69 MPa D2 gas. showed austenitic SSs susceptible HIC elevated temperatures, susceptibility decreased Ni content increased 15 25 wt%. Han [19], Chen [20] Lai [21] attributed susceptibility difference among austenitic SSs preference martensite formation based result martensite (BCT structure) vulnerable hydrogen embrittlement austenite (FCC structure), is, unstable austenitic SSs prone suffer HIC.Authors presume corrosion behavior steel hydrogenated hot water strongly depends temperature hydrogen behavior (e.g. diffusion, solubility, defect-trapping) steel does. Dissolved-hydrogen content water might affect, too. Furthermore, DH effect SCC nucleation process growth process possibly different, CGR method le suitable investigation crack nucleation behavior. study, effect test temperature DH content SCC susceptibility solution-annealed 316 L SS investigated SSRT method SCC behavior mechanism discussed focusing temperature/DH content dependence SCC nucleation process.2.

Discussion4.1. Testing method differenceIn study, author re-examined SCC behavior "solution-annealed" 316 L SS oxygenated hot water SSRT method. obtained result exhibited ductile behavior crack found specimen surfaces. Meanwhile, Zhang [22] measured CGR cold-worked 316 LNG SS simulated PWR primary water various contents. result showed typical IGSCC fractured side surface, CGR increased increasing content. difference might owing two reasons. One material specimen condition cold-working condition, heat treatment condition (e.g. solution-annealed sensitized) specimen geometry. considered SCC mechanism different among specimen different heat treatment conditions. traditional understanding SCC susceptibility based phenomenon sensitized 304 SS Cr depletion grain boundary critical. recent interest focusing SCC observed solution-annealed 316 L SS Cr depletion longer critical. Although might universal SCC mechanism work metallic materials, also considered SCC mechanism intrinsically depends material conditions.As specimen geometry, specimen thickness affect stress state change fracture mode. thickness tensile specimen study ∼0.5 mm, may plane stress state loading. contrary, Zhang's 1/2 CT specimen measure 12.5 mm thickness, may plane strain plane strain/stress mixed state. stress state difference affect plastic zone size plastic constraint. plane stress state, relatively larger plastic zone shape around crack tip, plane strain mixed state, relatively smaller plastic zone exists. plastic constraint former state smaller, latter relatively higher. property subsequently affect crack propagation behavior.The testing method. Authors expect factor controlling SCC susceptibility different crack nucleation process propagation process. SSRT, said constant-velocity moving cross-head result initiation fracture tensile specimen; CGR-CT test, constant-loading make pre-crack propagate. Thus, continuous loading SSRT finally result fracture affect SCC susceptibility metal dissolution crack-tip higher cold-working rate shortens testing period. hand, CGR-CT method, applied stress constant-loading crack-tip relaxed elapsing time test period long enough corrosion. said crack advancement much controlled metal dissolution rather loading condition. is, though testing environment, SSRT CGR-CT test might lead different cracking behavior. considered strain rate study (5 × 10−7s-1) might low enough induce SCC solution-annealed 316 L SS oxygenated water low enough SCC hydrogenated water.4.2. SCC behaviorUnder condition deaerated hydrogenated water, fracture mode shifted ductile brittle fracture increasing DH content, presented Fig. 5(c) (f). Despite RA TG + IG% remarkably changed DH content, crack length crack opening distance seemed increase DH content. worth notice SCC initiate IG crack very-near surface propagates TG crack late stage deformation accompanied necking. Fig. 11(c) example IG initiation-TG propagation pattern. Arioka's group [3] also reported IG crack initiation TG crack propagation specimen tested pressurized water (320 °C, DH = 30 cc/kg). two result quite similar, although testing temperature, pressure DH content different. Arioka [23] commented fracture mode change owing strain rate effect.Authors also take strain rate effect account give following explanation fracture mode change. Since stable thick oxide film formed specimen surface deaerated/hydrogenated water, active dissolution hydrogen production grain boundary specimen surface might trigger IGSCC late stage deformation material work-hardened. meantime, necking start stain rate accelerates. limit active dissolution hydrogen production within very-near surface, consequence, suppresses IGSCC growth. IGSCC substituted TGSCC probably deformation band susceptible SCC even higher strain rate.Several study provided similar explanation testing result hydrogenated water. Nono et al. [16] found TGSCC soultion-annealed 316 L SS SSRT 288 °C DH = 0.4 ppm. result showed enhancement TGSCC cold-work. suggested TG cracking relates deformation structure, dislocation band dislocation cell structure. Zhong et al. [13] studied effect DH surface condition IGSCC initiation small crack growth non-sensitized 316 SS tested simulated PWR primary water. indicated surface condition affected SCC, reflected cold-work enhanced SCC susceptibility. Choi et al. [14] investigated crack growth behavior warm-rolled 316 L SS high-temperature hydrogenated water. found CGR warm-rolled specimen higher as-received ones. concluded slip band sensitized grain boundary warm-rolled specimen played role path active corrosion SCC, hence path effective CGR DH. Finally, also concluded DH destabilizes protective oxide layer accelerated corrosion rate.In SSRT, said elongated specimen strengthened cold-work cold-working increase test progresses. late stage deformation, cold-work developed complex dislocation structure (e.g. dislocation cell structure, slip band, deformation band, etc.), structures, strengthen material, gradually become susceptible SCC.4.3. SCC mechanism hydrogenated waterThe SCC mechanism involve "active dissolution" "hydrogen embrittlement." core concept former metal dissolution lead separation atomic bond latter forced atomic bond breaking. latter derives name detrimental effect hydrogen-induced de-cohesion atom verified gaseous environment [24,25]. Since brittle fracture involves weakening interatomic bonding strength grain boundary lattice, namely, "active dissolution" mechanism potential mechanism participate bond-weakening subsequent cracking process deaerated/hydrogenated hot water.Considering steel deformed hydrogenated water late stage deformation, thin oxide film formed lack oxidants, steel matrix highly strengthened cold-working complex dislocation structure (e.g. deformation band). anodic cathodic reaction tiny crack-tip might " → Mn+ + ne−" " H2 + 2H2O + ne−→ 2OH− + 2H2", respectively. produced hydrogen around crack-tip local region well DH may trapped grain boundary deformation bands. amount trapped hydrogen reach critical level cause de-cohesion grain boundary lattice, trigger SCC cause "IG initiation-TG propagation" fracture pattern.That is, late stage deformation, highly applied stress cold-work, absence thick protective oxide film, metal dissolution (corrosion) critical hydrogen amount necessary sufficient condition SCC occur. Authors think SCC observed study hydrogen-assisted SCC (HASCC), characteristic hydrogen behavior may explain testing temperature dependence SCC occurrence hydrogenated water.4.4. Test temperature dependenceThere two issue discussed section: corrosion rate hydrogen behavior HASCC model. corrosion rate, Fig. 12 show oxide film thickens temperature increase (in DH = 0.4 1.4 ppm condition). oxide film product reaction oxidants/water metal ion involves metal ion dissolution, oxide film thickness reflects anodic reaction rate metal ion dissolving rate. Since anodic reaction couple cathodic reaction keep charge conservation, rate increment anode equivalent cathode. mean hydrogen production rate well increased elevating temperature.Test temperature significantly affect hydrogen behavior steel, solubility, diffusivity, permeability trapping. low temperatures, hydrogen trapping efficiency high hydrogen cannot travel long distance low diffusivity. elevated temperatures, although diffusivity high enough hydrogen travel aggregate trapping sites, hydrogen trapping efficiency lowered diminished contribution binding energy. two factor determine trapped hydrogen amount steel. Un-trapped free hydrogen tends diffuse outward egress steel. trapped hydrogen critical amount, hydrogen incapable cracking. regarded reason HIC susceptibility peak intermediate temperature range HIC le likely occur RT. Nevertheless, comparing HIC behavior, HASCC work fall elevated temperature region (150 °C above). corrosion necessary condition trigger HASCC, cohesive force reduction hydrogen atom another necessary condition cause cracking mentioned before.Hydrogen diffusion distance elevated temperature critical. Based Fick’s second law Arrhenius law, hydrogen diffusion distance, XH, metal described following equations:(1)XH=2DHtwhere Eq. (1),(2)DH=D0exp-EdkTwhere, DH diffusivity hydrogen, testing time, D0 diffusion coefficient, Ed activation energy, k Boltzmann constant absolute temperature. Presuming D0 = 1.0 × 10−6 (m2/s), Ed = 0.49 (eV), k = 8.6171 × 10-5(eV/K) = 561(K), hydrogen diffusivity pure γ-iron 288 °C 3.93 × 10-11 (m2/s). defect-existing real steel, diffusivity 1/25 value, 1.57 × 10-12 (m2/s). TE specimen tested DH = 0.1, 0.4 1.4 ppm, roughly 40%, author took average test derived 8.2 × 105 sec testing time. Eq. (1), hydrogen diffusion distance testing temperature - 288 °C, 220 °C, 150 °C RT - 1.61 mm, 0.80 mm, 0.31 mm 0.02 mm, respectively. diffusion distance 288 °C 220 °C larger specimen thickness (0.5 mm), mean hydrogen diffuses specimen center region testing, hydrogen abundant time aggregate reach critical amount cause cracking. contrary, hydrogen diffusion limited near surface RT. Thus, estimated diffusion distance reasonably explains HASCC model temperature dependence (c.f. Fig. 9, Fig. 10), although calculation many assumptions. addition, yield stress metal generally reduces test temperature, resulting softening subsequent HIC susceptibility reduction. However, yield stress 316 L SS show remarkable temperature dependence RT 288 °C FCC structure lower Pierls stress.4.5. Effect DH contentAs previously discussed, elevated temperatures, hydrogen diffusivity diffusion distance steel high long enough hydrogen travel aggregate potential cracking sites, resultantly cracking occurs reaching critical hydrogen amount. Hydrogen come DH hot water cathodic reaction (which denoted reaction-produced hydrogen, abbreviated "RH" later discussion) contribute aggregation. Increasing DH content directly raise solute hydrogen steel facilitates aggregation process, lower corrosion potential, anodic-cathodic reaction rate RH content time.Besides, noted viewpoint coupled anodic-cathodic reaction, increasing DH may sometime increase anodic reaction rate trend seen Fig. 12. 288 °C, oxide film thickness appears slightly increase DH content increase almost zero 0.4 ppm. Hou et al. [26] investigated effect hydrogen charging dissolution Alloy 600 288 °C. showed hydrogen Alloy 600 enhanced dissolution, named phenomenon "hydrogen accelerated oxidation (HAO)". Authors thinking HAO can’t directly applied present case, complex relationship DH RH, higher DH content may always raise trapped-hydrogen amount. Increasing DH often may accelerate aggregation rate facilitating degradation, sometimes decelerate mitigating degradation. account variable result observed previous work study. [3,[13], [14], [15], [16]]4.6. SCC susceptibility DH-temperature dependenceIn study, SCC found specimen tested 288 °C water DH content 0.4 1.4 ppm. fracture mode specimen "IG initiation-TG propagation" pattern. addition, SCC occurred specimen tested 220 °C DH = 1.4 ppm only. fracture mode TGSCC. One notice SCC boundary line fall 220 °C 288 °C DH = 0.4 ppm gradually decrease 150 °C DH = 1.4 ppm, shown Fig. 13. Apparently, test temperature DH content affect SCC susceptibility: higher temperature DH content, higher SCC susceptibility is. result imply combined role temperature DH content determining SCC susceptibility.Download : Download high-res image (143KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 13. map SCC susceptibility-coupling temperature water condition obtained study.As mentioned section 4.3, critical trapped-hydrogen amount necessary induce HASCC. hydrogen content trapped site, CHT, expressed following equation:(3)CHT=CLexp(EbkT)where CL hydrogen content steel, Eb defect-hydrogen binding energy, k Boltzmann constant absolute temperature. Eq. (3) reveals trapped hydrogen (or trapping ability steel) diminishes temperature increases. Authors assume CL proportional summation DH RH, CL Eq. (3) equal toα(DH+RH), α proportional constant relating hydrogen absorption process. Thus, Eq. (3) becomes:(4)CHT=α(DH+RH)exp(EbkT)In Eq. (4), increasing DH content may raise trapped-hydrogen amount, increment may decrease RH content time. Meanwhile, increasing temperature may raise RH content, although reduces trapped-hydrogen amount well exponential term. Integrating Eq. (4) Eq. (2) derives hydrogen aggregating rate trapping site, expressed follows:(5)DH∙CHT=D0α(DH+RH)exp-Ed-EbkTIt said higher aggregating rate, sooner HASCC would occur; vice versa, smaller, slower HASCC occurs. temperature dependent formula might named "HASCC indicator."Authors considered that, RT 288 °C, oxidation rate hydrogen diffusion rate control SCC occurrence, SCC susceptibility increased temperature. temperature region critical hydrogen diffuse trapped depending temperature DH content. temperature region, SCC susceptibility may reduce reduction trapped-hydrogen amount. Combining effect DH content temperature reasonably explains complex phenomenon SCC hydrogenated water.Finally, presuming SCC observed study belongs HASCC accompanied work hardening, corrosion hydrogen absorption, said SCC susceptibility depends test temperature DH content, reasonably explained term corrosion induced hydrogen production suppressing formation protective oxide film specimen surface hydrogen, hydrogen-induced reduction cohesive force lattice atom steel.5. ConclusionsSCC susceptibility solution-annealed 316 L SS hot water 288 °C evaluated SSRT strain rate 5 × 10−7s-1 oxygenated, deaerated hydrogenated water. obtained main result shown follows:1)SCC never observed specimen tested oxygenated water study. However, deaerated hydrogenated water, SCC occurred late stage deformation accompanied necking.2)The dissolved hydrogen water affect metal-oxygen reaction oxide film thickness. 288 °C, minimum thickness observed deaerated water condition. Meanwhile, film thickness increase temperature 288 °C.3)At 288 °C, SCC occurred deaerated hydrogenated water, 220 °C, SCC occurred highest DH content (DH = 1.4 ppm) only. indicates combination DH content test temperature reasonably explains complex phenomenon SCC hydrogenated water. test temperature dependence attributed temperature dependence anodic reaction rate, hydrogen diffusion rate hydrogen trapping ability.4)The SCC observed study interpreted term hydrogen-assisted SCC (HASCC) accompanied work hardening, corrosion hydrogen absorption. HASCC depends test temperature DH content.These trend reasonably explained mechanism including corrosion-induced hydrogen production, suppression formation protective oxide film specimen surface, work-hardening hydrogen-induced reduction cohesive force lattice atom steel.AcknowledgementsAuthors would like thank student contributed study.

IntroductionLaser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) one main category metal additive manufacturing (AM) technology, selective laser melting (SLM) widely used technique category. SLM process, focused laser beam used selectively melt multiple layer powder bed succession produce complex, functional metallic component according initial computer-aided-design (CAD) file [1]. date, wide range metal alloy successfully fabricated SLM, including 316L SS, 304L SS, 15-5 PH SS, AlSi10Mg, Scalmalloy (AlMgSc), CoCr, 718, Ti6Al4V, CuSn10 various functional use, especially aerospace, biomedical, automotive industries.To date, significant amount research metal focused process–microstructure–property relationship. particular, emphasis given influence various processing parameter laser power, scan speed, scan line (hatch) spacing, layer thickness microstructures resulting property fracture, yield, tensile strengths, fatigue life, well corrosion tribological property [2,3,4,5,6,7,8]. Studies shown AM-fabricated metallic component posse similar even enhanced properties, compared conventionally manufactured (CM) part [9,10,11,12]. improvement properties, e.g., strength, generally attributed unique multi-scale microstructures, much finer grain sizes, presence ultrafine/nano-sized precipitate [13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20]. Furthermore, effort standardization qualification metal part actively carried organization American Society Testing Materials (ASTM) National Institute Standards Technology (NIST) publishing various standard pertaining additively manufactured metallic component [21,22,23,24,25,26,27].While research process–microstructure–property relationship metallic part certainly important, another equally essential aspect given le attention property metal powder used processing, i.e., feedstock materials. far, available study literature revealed quality feedstock material play major role determining quality as-built parts, particularly densification level porosity content [28,29,30]. fact, quality metal powder used often assessed physical property particle size, particle size distribution (PSD), morphology, packing density flowability, well chemical composition. turn, quality metal powder significantly determined powder manufacturing method, water atomization (WA), gas atomization (GA), plasma rotating electrode process (PREP) prevalent technique [28,31,32,33,34,35]. Nevertheless, L-PBF AM, high packing density high flowability desired ensure optimal powder melting homogeneous deposition powder bed layer [36]. Thus, term morphology, smooth, spherical particle little satellites/defects possible desirable [29,37,38,39]. addition, Hajnys et al. [37], Liu et al. [40], Benson et al. [41] explained wide PSD mix large fine particle size improve packing density powder bed accumulation fine powder within interstitial space exist around larger powder particles. However, study also shown slightly reduced flowability wide PSD used fabrication due increased inter-particle friction, thereby suggesting compromise needed selecting particle size attain highest possible packing density maximizing flowability [42,43,44]. hand, several researcher recommend different nominal powder particle size used starting feedstock L-PBF processes, e.g., 10–60 [28], 10–45 [29], 5–80 μm [45]. Nonetheless, regardless particle size range chosen processing, powder particle need spherical free defect mentioned previously.On hand, back 2016, Honeywell projected metal industry experience immense growth amounting $3.1 billion next 5–10 year [46]. However, relatively high cost virgin powder L-PBF (~$100–$200/kg) high usage volume per build (~40–50 kg needed fill powder dispenser L-PBF machine) could major obstacle could increase overall production cost along supply chain [47,48,49,50,51,52]. Thus, often economically viable reuse/recycle powder build cycles. However, recycling used powder may induce alteration physical property chemistry, could affect eventual mechanical property as-built part [27]. fact, study shown recycled powder almost always larger particle sizes, rougher surface areas, reduced particle circularity, increased contamination, higher uptake oxygen, nitrogen, inert gas regardless number reuse time [53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61].For example, Zhang et al. [47] attributed rougher texture increased number satellite recycled 15-5 PH SS powder used L-PBF repeated heating/cooling cycle processing increased inter-particle friction powder bed recoating, compared virgin counterpart. Galicki et al. [56] Heiden et al. [57] reported increased uptake oxygen recycled 316L SS powder due oxidation occurs manufacturing presence residual oxygen build chamber. Similarly, Gorji et al. [38] detected increase metal oxide content recycled 316L SS powder, initially spherical particle evolved irregularly shaped morphology, together presence agglomerate spatter. However, Mellin et al. [62] Lutter-Gunther et al. [63] discovered insignificant change oxidation level recycled 316L SS powders, hypothesized element high affinity oxygen Cr, Mn, Fe diffuse powder surface fabrication process. Nevertheless, increased oxygen absorption oxide formation need taken consideration reusing recycled powder may adversely affect performance eventual as-built part service [28,29]. hand, Hajnys et al. [37] observed increase PSD recycled 316L SS powder considered reuse acceptable. Similarly, although Nezhadfar et al. [64] observed satellite porosity surface recycled 316L SS powder 12 time reuse, reported inconclusive trend ductility mechanical strength solidified parts. Interestingly, study also shown phase change could occur recycled 316L SS SS alloy >10 time reuse without considerable change physical chemical properties, well apparent density hardness, implying recycled powder still reused build cycle [57,65].Moreover, direct investigation packing density flowability virgin recycled powder L-PBF based established ASTM standard shown interesting results. example, Seyda et al. [66] observed increased flowability recycled Ti6Al4V powder 12 reuse times, attributed reduced number satellite fine particle despite coarsening powder particles, become increasingly irregularly shaped increasing PSD value [66]. Quintana et al. [55] reported similar result recycled Ti6Al4V powder increasing content oxygen 0.09 wt.% 0.13 wt.% 31 reuse times. even reported comparatively higher tensile strength part built using recycled powder due oxide strengthening effect. However, Tang et al. [67] revealed Ti6Al4V powder particle became rougher le spherical fewer satellite 21 build cycles, PSD actually became narrower still exhibited improved flowability without compromise tensile property as-built parts. addition, Cordova et al. [36] studied physical chemical properties, well packing density flowability, virgin recycled Ti6Al4V, AlSi10Mg, Scalmalloy, 718 various reuse times. general, recycled powder displayed increased flowability maintained high packing density due reduced number satellite fine particles. concluded would enable optimal powder melting subsequently homogeneous deposition powder build platform.Hence, study shown importance evaluating understanding change occur powder undergoing numerous build cycle term quality control consideration reuse recycled powder fabrication. However, comprehensive study still limited term correlation change physical chemical property virgin recycled metal powder processing, feasibility reuse [24,36,55]. Therefore, study, physical chemical property virgin recycled 316L SS AlSi10Mg powder used particularly SLM processing characterized compared via following approaches: (i) Microstructural observation scanning electron microscopy (SEM), (ii) chemical composition analysis electron-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), (iii) phase analysis X-ray diffraction (XRD). result study compared available literature qualitatively ass suitability recycled powder reuse. 2. Materials MethodsFour batch gas-atomized 316L SS AlSi10Mg powder (2 fresh set (virgin), 2 used set (recycled)) used study. fresh powder obtained as-received state supplier, Concept Laser, recycled powder taken powder dispenser container Laser Cusing M2 SLM machine. following chemical composition virgin powder listed Concept Laser (in wt.%): (i) 316L SS; Cr: 16.5–18.5; Ni: 10.0–13.0; Mo: 2.0–2.5; Mn: 0–2.0; Si: 0–1.0; P: 0–0.045; C: 0–0.03; S: 0–0.03; Fe: Bal. (ii) AlSi10Mg; Si: 10.5–13.5; Mg: 0–0.05; Fe: 0–0.55; Mn: 0–0.35; Ti: 0–0.15; Cu: 0–0.05; Zn: 0–0.10; C: 0–0.05; Ni: 0–0.05; Pb: 0–0.05; Sn: 0–0.05, Al: Bal.The recycled powder used 20 time prior collection. noted SLM process, build chamber purged nitrogen limit contamination oxidation much possible. addition, recycled powder also sieved particle larger 80 μm 316L SS, 50 μm AlSi10Mg prior characterization.The size, morphology, circularity, distribution virgin recycled powder particle evaluated via JSM-JEOL 9500 scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL Tokyo, Japan) observation combined analysis SEM image using ImageJ software (V 1.52, NIH LOCI, Wisconsin, WI, USA). change chemical composition virgin recycled powder assessed using EDX analysis, phase evolution determined X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis using Bruker D2 Phaser powder diffraction machine (θ/2θ configuration, range: 40–100°, Bruker, Billerica, MI, USA). 3. Results Discussion 3.1. Microstructural Analysis 3.1.1. Morphology DistributionThe morphology cumulative particle size distribution (PSD) virgin recycled 316L SS AlSi10Mg powder shown Figure 1. clear powder particle virgin powder largely spherical near-spherical (Figure 1a,d), irregularly shaped particles, cylindrical tear-drop morphologies, observed virgin AlSi10Mg powder (Figure 1d). surface recycled powder also appear rougher compared initially smooth virgin powders. addition, fine particle called satellite (<5 μm) attached surface virgin 316L SS AlSi10Mg powder (e.g., dashed arrow zoomed area Figure 1a,d), common virgin metallic powder produced gas atomization process [37,42,68]. However, fewer satellite observed recycled powder shown Figure 1b,d, often attributed detachment surface unmelted powder particle blown as-built part [27,55,67]. Figure 1. (a) Virgin, (b) recycled, (c) cumulative particle size distribution 316L SS powders; (d) virgin, (e) recycled, (f) cumulative particle distribution AlSi10Mg powders. Dashed arrow zoomed area inset (a,d) show satellite surface virgin powders. addition, agglomeration small powder particle larger one could observed recycled 316L SS, shown Figure 1b. agglomerate typically caused spattering unmelted powder (powder spatter) powder bed upon contact laser heat source SLM fabrication, attached unconsolidated semi-consolidated powder particle [36,37,38,47]. Similarly, study shown agglomerate could also arise melted powder particle ejected powder bed (droplet spatter), eventually solidify flight either adhere as-fabricated part impinge powder particle [69,70,71,72].Although recycled 316L SS powder largely retain spherical/near-spherical shape (Figure 1b), recycled AlSi10Mg powder generally deform irregular shape (Figure 1e). Interestingly, powder particle apparently larger set recycled powder (Figure 1b,e) compared virgin counterpart (Figure 1a,d). also quantified cumulative distribution function showing average particle size (D50) virgin recycled powder (Figure 1c,f). value D50 virgin recycled 316L SS powder ~22 μm ~29 μm, respectively, higher virgin recycled AlSi10Mg powders: ~11 μm ~13 μm, respectively. could ascribed melting smaller powder particle previous SLM processing [47]. higher D50 value recycled powder study similar obtained various recycled metal powder observed studies, often show wider distribution variation particle size [36,58,59]. Nevertheless, Figure 2 indicates 316L SS powder consists wide range particle size broad size distribution (0–80 μm) compared AlSi10Mg powder comprises relatively finer particle size narrower size distribution (0–50 μm). Figure 2. Examples powder morphology recycled 316L SS (a–c) AlSi10Mg (d–f): (a,d) Deformed powders, rough surface, sintering neck (circled area Figure 2d); (b,e) incomplete powder melting fusion; (c,f) powder agglomeration due spatter. hand, several noteworthy observation made morphology recycled 316L SS AlSi10Mg powder shown high-magnification SEM image Figure 2. example, Figure 2a,d show deformation powder irregular shape visibly rougher surface texture compared initially smooth virgin powder particles. number factor related occurrences, including: (i) Continuous melting cooling cycle processing, (ii) remelting powder upon exposure laser heat source, (iii) friction among powder particle spreading successive powder bed layers, long exposure time high temperature fabrication process [29,36,67,73].In addition, sintering neck observed form two adjacent powder particle recycled AlSi10Mg powders, shown circled area Figure 2d. Similarly, Figure 2b exhibit fusion partially melted powder particle unmelted one recycled 316L SS, example incomplete fusion differently sized powder recycled AlSi10Mg shown Figure 2e. Altogether, occurrence phenomenon attributed insufficient heat input considerable temperature difference loose powder powder already fused [74,75,76]. identified undesirable defect contribute surface roughness as-built parts, also, importantly, porosity could compromise strength service property [6,67,68,77].Furthermore, agglomeration powder particle due droplet powder spatter, previously observed Figure 1b,e, shown detail Figure 2c,f recycled 316L SS AlSi10Mg powders, respectively. cases, size agglomerate measured >45 μm. 316L SS, much smaller powder particle ranging 5 15 μm impinged larger powder particle >45 μm. AlSi10Mg, particle size 5–20 μm observed clustered together, whereas larger particle remain either free agglomerates, fewer satellite attached onto them. Interestingly, clumped particle different morphology include spherical, near-spherical, irregularly shaped ones. contrast agglomerate recycled 316L SS, much smaller spherical near-spherical powder particle attached larger powder particle similar morphologies. ascribed higher tendency fine particle size narrow size distribution agglomerate, compared possessing comparatively larger particle size wider size distribution, case AlSi10Mg 316L SS powder study, respectively [78,79].Moreover, histogram Figure 3 reveal PSD virgin recycled 316L SS AlSi10Mg powder detail. virgin recycled 316L SS powder (Figure 3a,b) exhibit comparatively wider size distribution AlSi10Mg powder (Figure 3c,d), ranging 0 80 μm 0 50 μm, respectively. clear shift toward higher PSD values, i.e., increasing percentage larger particle sizes, observed: >25 μm 316L SS (Figure 3b) >10 μm AlSi10Mg (Figure 3d). time, fewer fine particle ranging 0 5 μm observed recycled powder (Figure 3b,d). confirms higher D50 value observed recycled powder shown cumulative PSD graph Figure 1c,f, attributed presence agglomerate removal satellite fabrication [36,67]. Figure 3. Powder particle size distribution virgin recycled 316L SS (a,b respectively) AlSi10Mg (c,d respectively) powders. 3.1.2. CircularityIn addition SEM observation provide visual qualitative assessment powder particle shapes, circularity factor, C, introduced evaluate morphology virgin recycled 316L SS AlSi10Mg powders, given formula [80]: C = 4πA/P2 (1) P perimeter (μm) pore area (μm2), determined ImageJ software. C value close 1 indicate near-perfect circular particles, C value close 0 demonstrate increasingly irregularly shaped particles. result calculation shown Table 1. Table 1. Average circularity virgin recycled 316L SS AlSi10Mg powders. clear virgin powder posse higher average circularity value recycled powders, slightly higher value 316L SS (0.89 ± 0.11) AlSi10Mg (0.83 ± 0.17). suggests rounder regular shape virgin 316L SS compared virgin AlSi10Mg, confirming SEM observation Figure 1a,d. average circularity recycled 316L SS powder remains virtually unchanged 0.87 ± 0.13, recycled AlSi10Mg powder decrease 0.69 ± 0.31. correlate well observation Figure 1b,d, 316L SS powder particle largely retain spherical near-spherical shapes, whereas AlSi10Mg powder particle tend deform irregular shape upon reuse SLM fabrication. hand, representative visual example powder particle circularity shown Figure 4. range morphology observed corresponding circularity, highest circularity, C = 1, obtained virgin 316L SS powder (Figure 4a), lowest circularity evaluated C = 0.38 recycled AlSi10Mg powder (Figure 4e). Figure 4. Examples particle circularity metal powder used study. Representative image (a,b) taken 316L SS, (c–e) taken AlSi10Mg. 3.2. Compositional AnalysisSemi-quantitative EDX analysis conducted surface virgin recycled 316L SS AlSi10Mg powder determine chemical compositions, result presented Table 2. Table 2. Chemical composition virgin recycled powder via electron-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis (wt.%). observed composition main element virgin powder determined via EDX analysis (Table 2) corresponds well within range supplier-listed composition detailed Section 2. addition, composition element virgin recycled powder fluctuates slightly remains stable, except oxygen. 316L SS, oxygen content recycled powder increase ~3 time compared virgin powder, whereas double virgin powder recycled AlSi10Mg. increase oxygen content recycled powder expected observed various metal powder undergone processing study [36,47,55,67]. higher percentage oxygen recycled powder attributed number factors, including: (i) Oxygen pick-up due contaminants, moisture, residual oxygen might still present within build chamber despite purged protective inert gas argon nitrogen (this study); (ii) vaporization oxygen (a trace element) powder surface might already exist powder production upon contact laser heat source; (iii) exposure powder ambient air removal as-received part, sieving process, well powder handling storage [36,38,67].In particular, several study field powder metallurgy also shown strong affinity major alloying element Mn Si oxygen selective oxidization powder surface [81,82,83], might also case 316L SS AlSi10Mg powder subjected fabrication study, respectively. fact, Simonelli et al. [69] found high affinity Mn Si oxygen reason element selectively oxidized surface molten material spatter-ejected powder bed, solidify flight build chamber. Nevertheless, study could include EDX map analysis visual confirmation presence oxide surface powders. addition, important thing note EDX commonly used semi-quantitative tool determine chemical composition material, exact value detected might accurate, particularly trace element oxygen [42,47,61]. Thus, detailed surface chemical analysis necessary, using X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), obtain accurate reading chemical compositions, well detect thin surface oxide layer may present surface powder [47,70]. Nonetheless, EDX analysis study adequately capture trend increasing oxygen content recycled powders, suggests deviation chemical composition within acceptable range material [84,85]. 3.3. Phase AnalysisThe phase identification virgin recycled 316L SS AlSi10Mg powder shown XRD spectrum Figure 5. Figure 5. XRD spectrum virgin recycled 316L SS (a) AlSi10Mg (b) powders. Figure 5a show phase change virgin recycled 316L SS powder, remain single γ-austenite FCC structure. Similarly, recycled AlSi10Mg powder exhibit identical peak Al Si virgin counterpart (Figure 5b). additional peak observed, suggesting change phase (if any) XRD detection limit represents little contamination within build chamber, therefore, negligible [38,70]. However, hypothesis insignificant contamination build cycle might seem paradoxical, seeing EDX result show increasing oxygen content recycled powder often associated presence contaminant inside build chamber. Thus, reasonable explanation even though phase change observed XRD spectra, could still occur limit detection XRD equipment used study. Furthermore, nitrogen known austenite stabilizer and, especially 316L SS, presence nitrogen build chamber processing might even suppress formation phase despite three-fold increase oxygen content detected EDX analysis recycled powder.In fact, Heiden et al. [57] conducted electron-backscattered diffraction (EBSD) XRD analysis virgin recycled 316L SS observed presence δ-ferrite BCC phase recycled powder (reused 30 times). Jacob et al. [65] observed progressive increase ferritic-martensitic BCC phase 17-4 PH stainless-steel powder via XRD analysis minimum use four times. addition, Simonelli et al. [69] detected enrichment thin Mn Mg oxide film surface recycled 316L SS AlSi10Mg powder EDX map analysis, respectively. attributed growth oxide film volatile nature Mn Mg high affinity toward oxygen [5,60,86]. Therefore, future investigation could include carrying EDX mapping, electron-backscattered diffraction (EBSD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis determine sub-micron-scale phase microstructures, definitively confirm whether phase observed recycled powders. 4. DiscussionIt known flowability packing density two important quality metal powder used PBF processing considerable influence quality as-built parts, together processing parameter applied [42,87,88]. Altogether, two property determined particle size, PSD, morphology, chemical composition powder [61,66,70]. However, increasing number uses, virgin powder initially favorable property undergo physical chemical change require evaluation decision made whether reused. Based guideline proposed Cordova et al. [36], recommended consider following five key aspect assessing suitability reusing powders, including: (i) Particle size distribution (PSD), (ii) powder morphology, (iii) chemical composition, (iv) flowability, (v) packing density.First, nominal powder PSD typically used SLM range 10–45 μm, much finer used PBF processes, electron beam melting (EBM) (45–106 μm) directed energy deposition (DED) (20–200 μm) [28,29,89]. architecture SLM machine allows fine powder distribution reduce surface roughness utilizing lower layer thicknesses, compared EBM DED counterpart enable use higher layer thickness larger particle size [90]. Based result study, PSD recycled powder fall within range, 80 μm 316L SS 50 μm AlSi10Mg. particular, recycled 316L SS powder sieved remove agglomerate unmelted particle size >45 μm.Secondly, powder morphology identified another important aspect need examined significantly influence flowability packing density. Smooth, spherical, dry particle posse best flowability characteristic due low inter-particle friction enable deposition densely solidified layer produce homogeneous microstructures [42,91]. hand, powder particle rough surface irregular shape reveal larger specific surface increase surface friction them, typically reducing flowability leaving void gap lead porosity as-built part [47,68]. Therefore, considered reuse, guideline provided Cordova et al. [36] recommended circularity factor recycled powder need close 1 possible, least ≥7.0. study, issue recycled 316L SS powder average circularity ~0.87, differ much virgin counterpart (~0.89). However, average circularity recycled AlSi10Mg ~0.69, borderline value suggested. Thus, recycled AlSi10Mg might still considered uses, noncritical component outside high-risk industries, e.g., aerospace sector biomedical application [38]. Furthermore, reuse >30 build cycle generally recommended, due severe degradation deteriorates quality metal powders, often observed powder various metallic materials, including considerable agglomerate satellites, noticeable deformation distortion highly irregular shape [55,57,68,92].Thirdly, chemical composition recycled powder must measured ensure remain within alloy-specific compositions, address issue loss due evaporation spatter, contamination within build chamber powder handling recovery, well pick-up oxygen trace element nitrogen argon build process [29,36]. addition, (significant) phase change occur recycled powder, change crystal structure, e.g., additional peak XRD spectra, precipitate oxide layer detected TEM XPS, would result considerable contamination could negatively impact structural mechanical property fabricated part [38,70]. present investigation, EDX analysis show 2–3 time increase oxygen content recycled powders, could caused residual oxygen present chamber, evaporation entrapped oxygen within powder (from gas atomization powder production process) due powder droplet spatter [1,93]. Nevertheless, XRD spectrum analysis show unexpected peak recycled powders, chemical composition remain within acceptable range 316L SS AlSi10Mg alloys. Therefore, based EDX XRD results, least, reuse recycled powder considered acceptable. However, detailed analysis XPS, EBSD, EDX mapping, TEM reveal undesired precipitates, oxides, phase recycled powders, recycled powder used structural critical end-use applications.The last two guideline Cordova et al. [36] recommend flowability packing density recycled powder directly measured analytical tool following various ASTM international standards. High flowability high packing density desired ensure homogeneous deposition powder bed layer optimal powder melting, would lead high densification low porosity level as-built parts. particular, packing density powder bed found important processing parameter laser power (P), scan speed (S), hatch spacing (d), layer thickness (h) determining part density porosity [36,42]. Smooth spherical particle minimal defect known improve packing density, irregularly shaped particle numerous defect agglomerate satellite reduce packing density powder bed, similar influence powder flowability [29,39,94]. addition, inclusion fine powder particle (fines) also contributes high packing density due fine particle filling interstitial space exist among larger particle [40,44,90]. However, fine particle tend result wider PSD found reduce powder flowability [30,36,55,67]. Therefore, compromise, suggested smooth, spherical particle minimum defect possible narrower PSD used fabrication attain optimized flowability relatively high packing density [29,37,42].In study, direct measurement flowability packing density carried out. However, comparative analysis current result discussion first three recommendation Cordova et al. [36], well established literature, still made provide qualitative assessment viability reusing recycled powder study (after 20 time use). property recycled powder analyzed study, powder characteristic suitable reuse suggested available literature, recommendation author regarding possible reuse recycled powder listed Table 3. Based comparative analysis, author suggest reuse recycled 316L SS AlSi10Mg powder acceptable 30 build cycle overall, reuse beyond require re-evaluation detailed physical chemical characterizations. Table 3. Qualitative analysis recommendation reuse recycled powder present study based result established available literature. 5. ConclusionsIn study, property 316L SS AlSi10Mg powder virgin condition recycled state 20 time reuse analyzed compared using SEM, EDX, XRD techniques. Qualitative assessment viability using recycled powder build cycle made based result study recommended available literature. following conclusion made:(1) Compared virgin powders, shift higher particle size distribution (PSD) value observed, resulting higher average particle size 316L SS AlSi10Mg recycled powders.(2) SEM observation indicate presence agglomerates, fewer satellite detected surface recycled 316L SS AlSi10Mg powders.(3) recycled 316L SS powder particle retain spherical near-spherical morphologies, whereas AlSi10Mg counterpart deforms irregularly shaped morphologies.(4) average circularity recycled 316L SS powder reduces slightly ~2%, higher reduction circularity attained recycled AlSi10Mg powder (~17%).(5) EDX analysis suggests chemical composition recycled powder remains within alloy-specific values, increase oxygen pick-up detected cases.(6) XRD spectrum peak analysis indicate change crystal structure presence undesired precipitate recycled powders.(7) Based present result qualitative comparative analysis available literature, reuse recycled powder build cycle acceptable 30 overall build cycles.

Cladding performed using various process perform overlay welding shield metal arc welding (SMAW), gas metal arc welding (GMAW), gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), flux cored arc welding (FCAW), cold spray method, plasma arc welding (PAW), laser beam welding (LBW) electron beam welding (EBW) [1, 2]. process advantage limitation come characteristic cladding. various problem associated cladding reported literature including: (i) porosity due atmospheric gases, (ii) inclusion foreign particles, (iii) crack due thermal stress induced heating cooling, (iv) high dilution due excessive heating [3]. Therefore, based application deposited clad particular welding process selected.Copper interesting metal largely used property electrical thermal conductivity, excellent corrosion resistance management heat [4]. help diffusing heat local point larger area recommended fusion reactors, petroleum industries, crystallizers, etc. [5] However, poor strength, low hardness, poor wear resistance high temperature.

Stainless steel 316L usually considered marine grade stainless steel, corrosive resistant seawater. combination material many application fusion reactor marine applications. present study, SS316L considered substrate material providing high strength copper clad material provide required thermal, electrical corrosion resistant properties. However, coating copper stainless steel 316L highly challenging distinct difference material property two materials, including melting point, thermal conductivity, thermal expansion.For performing cladding, two major category process reported literature fusion-based process cold coating [6]. conventional fusion-based cladding process, one metal used electrode, directly absorbs arc heat melt participate cladding. often result excessive melting substrate accumulation Cu interface. Here, large amount stress developed interface due difference coefficient thermal expansion metals. cause Cu penetrate SS induce liquid embrittlement stainless steel [7]. Laser electron beam cladding relatively new technology better control heat involved deposition; however, challenging process copper using technique due inherit property reflective material. Theoretically, absorptivity copper laser literature 25% quite different experimentally. wavelength around 1 µm, absorptivity reported 3% room temperature 8 13% elevated temperature [8,9,10,11]. Reports present successful deposition copper SS316L surface using cold spray method; however, limited thin layer deposition deposition thick coating without porosity still challenge. Referring past literature, cladding copper cylindrical SS 316L surface limited effort made study using plasma welding source. fact motivated author work presented article.In present study, plasma welding source used confine welding energy confined area.

IntroductionIn Europe, year, 1 million hip replacements, approximately number USA. Nevertheless, 10–15 years, approximately 10% total hip arthroplasty (THA) need reintervention. Nowadays, ageing population, injury disease like arthrosis public health issues. avoid additional surgical reoperation improve lifetime duration implants, study orthopedic implant needed. Three different metal alloy used femoral stem: cobalt–chromium alloy, titanium alloy austenitic stainless steel. focus attention cemented hip prostheses. 1960, order decrease number femoral stem debonding, Sir John Charnley decided insert hip prosthesis poly(methyl methacrylate) called bone cement [1]. cemented prosthesis (Fig. 1), austenitic stainless steel (316L SS alloy) usually used femoral stem thanks biocompatibility high resistance corrosion biological environment without friction.Download : Download high-res image (306KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1. Total hip joint cemented prosthesis components.Because daily human gait significant difference mechanical property (particularly, Young's moduli) 316L SS bone cement, stress shielding phenomenon appears. metallic material polymer strain properties, thereby leading debonding femoral stem cement. involves fretting (friction small displacements, term precisely defined later) friction. Finally, upper part femoral bone unloaded becomes susceptible fracture; hand, bone around femoral stem tip overloaded, becomes stronger [2]. However, bone cement act “bumper” femoral stem bone, leveling peak force acting around prosthesis human gait.Femoral stem debonding consequently friction femoral stem bone cement lead cement degradation cracking (Fig. 1). Debris bone cement femoral stem (metal oxide ions) go cement bone tissue [3]. Thus, disturbance osteoblast cell activity tissue inflammation, respectively caused bone cement particle metallic oxide ions, involve implant reoperation. reason fretting-corrosion femoral stem bone cement, particle generation, one important cause reintervention [4], [5]. Consequently, fretting-corrosion experiment carried understanding corrosion mechanical influences, improving lifetime implants.Fretting mean friction small reciprocal displacements, amplitude displacement lower contact width. Rubin et al. found out, numerical modeling, amplitude displacement 50 μm (depending location) bone stem applied stress human gait [6]. Nonetheless, displacement amplitude bone cement femoral stem supposed identical [7].Wear metallic material conjugated effect mechanical solicitation (friction fretting case) corrosion medium (physiological liquid) named tribocorrosion [8].

Indeed, ionic strength interfere double layer constitution solution content “attraction–repulsion” phenomenon contact two material [12].The role protein also investigated. work focus albumin, main protein blood plasma. Afonso et al. [13] shown bovine serum albumin, NaCl 0.15 37 °C, UNS S31254 stainless steel, stop anodic dissolution chromium decrease iron dissolution. Valero Vidal et al. [14] worked 316L CoCrMo alloy NaCl 0.14 37 °C, without albumin (0.5 g L−1). showed 316L, albumin modify open circuit potential (OCP) act anodic inhibitor applied potential, i.e. increase cathodic reaction rate. Albumin also tends decrease polarization resistance, removing oxide protective layer exhibiting material surface corrosion. CoCrMo alloy, albumin act cathodic inhibitor also increase anodic reaction rate, i.e. accelerates corrosion. fretting-corrosion test Ti–6Al–4V alloy alumina pH buffered saline solution 37 °C, Hiromoto Mischler [15] showed albumin (1 g L−1 bovine serum albumin) mostly modifies cathodic behaviour act cathodic inhibitor, i.e. reduces cathodic reaction rate. mechanical point view, albumin affect friction coefficient μ wear volume.During fretting-corrosion test, material wear combination mechanical wear (fretting) corrosion. However, total material loss (W) determined sum two different material losses: (i) material loss due mechanical wear obtained without influence corrosion (Wm) (ii) material loss due corrosion obtained without fretting action (Wc). synergistic effect corrosion wear mechanical wear. synergy term (ΔW) mean corrosion increase wear due fretting (ΔWcm) friction increase wear due corrosion (ΔWmc) [16], [17].(2)W = Wm + Wc + ΔW = Wm + Wc + (ΔWcm + ΔWmc)This work aim understanding role mechanical action corrosion synergy term, also calculating term fretting-corrosion test. first place, focus percentage wear due corrosion obtained wear volume due corrosion Vcorr (cm3), percentage found Faraday's law:(3)%corrosivewear=VcorrW×100withVcorr=1F×Mnρ×i×twhere F Faraday constant (F = 96,500 C mol−1), molecular weight (M = 56.39 g mol−1), n number electron involved anodic process (n = 2, hypothesis), total duration fretting-corrosion test (t = 14,400 s), ρ density (ρ = 8 g cm−3) (A) difference average current fretting current fretting.Three electrochemical condition investigated study.

However, total wear volume without regard condition (ionic strength albumin). One may assume total wear volume equal mechanical wear volume Wm, i.e. Wm = 0.3 ± 0.1 × 106 μm3.Table 5.

Discussion4.1. Open circuit potential conditionsThe evolution OCP before, fretting shown Fig. 4. One may notice Ebf logarithmically decrease ionic strength accordance [20]. Chloride ions, Cl−, accelerate anodic dissolution formation unstable compound MCln (or M(H2O)yClx) [21]. high concentration chloride ions, one may suggest metallic dissolution higher lead OCP decrease.The drastic drop OCP occurs soon fretting start (Fig. 4), expressing surface degradation. passive layer 316L surface partly destroyed metal dissolution, i.e. anodic reaction, occurs. addition, breakdown passive layer highlighted polarization resistance (Rp) fall. Rp indeed inversely proportional corrosion rate (Stern–Geary equation): Rp fall involves acceleration corrosion.One may notice falls, ΔOCP ΔRp, decrease ionic strength (Fig. 5). According Macdonald [22], concentration Cl− increases, passive layer reconstruction becomes difficult. result highlighted Fig. 5 translates difficulty passive layer reconstruction fretting chloride concentration increases.The OCP Rp upturn, directly cessation fretting (Fig. 4), confirms corrosion activation fretting test. However, OCP value fretting lower Ebf. electrochemical behaviour 316L surface indeed modified le protective worn zone PMMA oxide debris deposed 316L surface.From mechanical point view, worth noting cumulated dissipated energy (Edc) fretting test increase ionic strength (Fig. 6). One may suggest ionic strength increases, attraction surface reinforced [23], [24].As shown Fig. 7, albumin influence average OCP fretting total wear volume 316L. Without friction, Valero Vidal et al. [14] showed albumin modify OCP values. concentration, 1 g L−1, albumin modify electrochemical behaviour: influence OCP fretting Rp values; total wear volume.4.2. Cathodic applied potential condition (E = −400 mV(SCE))The applied potential E = −400 mV(SCE) cathodic potential, i.e. current negative, thus surface protected corrosion. However, protection effective solutions. example, NaCl 10−3 mol L−1, protection effective: ΔI ∼ 1 μA effective NaCl 10−1 NaCl 1 mol L−1, respectively ΔI ∼ 7 μA ΔI ∼ 11 μA (Fig. 9). fretting-corrosion test, current even becomes positive, i.e. anodic, NaCl 1 mol L−1. fact, threshold concentration two surface behaviour determined (Fig. 11). concentration 10−1 mol L−1, wear volume OCP condition higher E = −400 mV(SCE): applied potential protects surface. concentration 10−1 mol L−1, wear volume OCP condition lower E = −400 mV(SCE): metal dissolution higher passive layer le protective fretting.Fig. 14 allows underlining preponderant wear phenomenon highlighted: corrosion mechanical wear. Experimental data close dashed straight line indicate preponderance corrosive wear. Corrosion also preponderant wear phenomenon high ionic strength: ∼80% NaCl 1 mol L−1 10−1 mol L−1 without albumin. One may notice that, presence albumin, percentage wear due corrosion decreases: ∼50% NaCl solution 1 mol L−1 10−1 mol L−1, instead 80% without albumin. Especially, presence albumin lower ionic strength, standard deviation value large coefficient variation range 10 100. preponderant phenomenon mechanical wear case, dispersion corrosive total wear value larger. main mechanical degradation, albumin NaCl solutions, involve hazardous wrenching related high standard deviation.Download : Download high-res image (150KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 14. total wear volume 316L SS, W, function wear due corrosion, Vcorr, logarithmic scale. dashed straight line: case wear due corrosion → W = Vcorr. Ionic strength decrease right left.4.3. Cathodic applied potential condition (E = −800 mV(SCE))As explained Section 1, total wear volume 316L SS sum wear due corrosion, Wc mechanical wear, Wm. total wear volume, W, follows Eq. (2). E = −800 mV(SCE), anodic current measured fretting-corrosion test. electrochemical condition, anodic dissolution, i.e. metallic dissolution, neglected without regard ionic strength presence albumin. mechanical wear Wm also determined: Wm = 0.3 ± 0.1 × 106 μm3. E = −400 mV(SCE), thanks Faraday's law, wear due corrosion Vcorr calculated (Eq. (3)). fact, comparison total wear volume (Eq. (2)), Vcorr = Wc + ΔWmc. deduction, term ΔWcm determined, function ionic strength E = −400 mV(SCE). set apart synergy term ΔW = ΔWmc + ΔWcm, term Wc must measured. polarization resistance values, dissolution current material, i, calculated: = B/Rp, B = 24 mV (hypothesis coming investigation COST 533 round robin). way, Wc ∼100 500 μm3 depending ionic strength. Wc represents 0.01% Vcorr neglected. Iwabuchi et al. found ratio: Wc/W ∼0.01% [25].Fig. 15a illustrates contribution ΔWmc, i.e. increase corrosive wear due fretting. Levels defined NaCl solution 10−1 mol L−1 without albumin: concentration, contribution corrosive wear 80%. Albumin concentration 1 g L−1 shift transition percentage corrosive wear: 10−2 mol L−1, contribution corrosive wear constant 50%. Thus, albumin decrease percentage corrosive wear. One may notice material behaviour Ringer solution different NaCl solutions. presence ion (Table 3), contribution corrosive wear decreases. example, role carbonate could determined future work. Fig. 15b illustrates contribution ΔWcm, increase mechanical wear due corrosion. trend defined: mechanical wear function ionic strength, term match arbitrary wrenching surface material.Download : Download high-res image (442KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 15. contribution different synergy term albumin (empty symbols) without albumin (full symbols): (a) ΔWmc/W increase corrosive wear due fretting (b) ΔWcm/W increase mechanical wear due corrosion.Diomidis et al. [26] worked new expression synergy term. Synergism fact acceleration material deterioration corrosion mechanical removal re-growth passive layer. Continuous intermittent sliding test completed measure material loss sliding track. intermittent sliding test allow removal re-growth passive layer. However, sliding condition fretting-corrosion test continuous passive layer destruction re-growth must different.In future work, influence albumin concentration metal behaviour studied. closer vivo conditions, experiment realized 10 20 g L−1. example, ISO standard indicates concentration protein equal 17.5 g L−1 improving lifetime hip implant [27], [28].As seen Fig. 10a, characteristic shape 316L wear track, ‘W’ wear shape mentioned [9], [10], consequence crevice corrosion. evolution local pH might lead particular shape. influence pH solution could give information crevice corrosion effect. crevice corrosion effect investigated investigations.5. ConclusionsUnder OCP conditions, increase chloride concentration lead higher corrosion difficult passive layer reconstruction friction phase. mechanical point view, Edc increase according ionic strength; consequently one might suggest attraction surface reinforced.At E = −400 mV(SCE), threshold concentration, around 10−1 mol L−1, highlight surface protective phenomenon occurs concentration, metal dissolution appears value.At E = −800 mV(SCE), mechanical wear determined: Wm = 0.3 ± 0.1 × 106 μm3. value needed calculate term synergy corrosive mechanical wear.Albumin, 1 g L−1, influence OCP conditions. However, E = −400 mV(SCE), percentage corrosive wear lower presence albumin. Albumin seems play role anodic inhibitor.When chloride concentration, i.e. ionic strength study, increases, 316L wear increase too. interesting result is: albumin promotes mechanical degradation compared corrosive wear, cathodic polarization. assertion includes pure mechanical degradation synergism mechanical wear assisted corrosion. One might suggest synergistic term key-point 316L wear, cathodic polarization.AcknowledgementsThe author wish acknowledge Saint-Etienne Métropole Conseil Général de la Loire financial support.

Metallic implant usually made one three type materials: 316L stainless steels, cobalt–chromium alloy titanium alloy [2]. material accepted body environment passive inert oxide layer formed surface. main elemental constituents, well minor alloying constituent material usually tolerated body trace amounts, since alloying element specific biological role. Cobalt–chromium alloy excellent corrosion resistance property. However, recommended joint prosthesis poor frictional property materials. Titanium alloy provide sufficient strength corrosion resistance: Ti-6Al-4V, Ti-5Al-2.5Fe, Ti-6Al-7Nb, etc. [3].

IntroductionFretting corrosion, arises friction two surface small displacement loading condition corrosive medium, related stability passive film metal alloy surface. show paper, passivity alloy susceptible fretting, mechanical friction may destroy barrier oxide layer rapidly barrier layer grow metal zero barrier layer thickness, thereby inducing depassivation [1]. probable process degradation occurs erosion–corrosion particle impact corrosion. However difference fretting corrosion particle impact corrosion lie property particle impacting surface alloy. key point wastage rate particle impact corrosion particle size (mass), particle flux, pH solution, etc. [1], important independent variable fretting corrosion include contact pressure, displacement, relative velocity two surface existence crevice, external chemical property often secondary importance.In case fretting corrosion, modeling degradation alloy term stability passive film complex task, involving large number variable describing system great physico-chemical complexity. carefully combining experimental study modeling, possible describe physico-electrochemical process involved fretting predict wear rate, i.e. wastage rate [2]. common strategy case fretting insulating material metallic alloy interpret fretting corrosion accelerated form corrosion due wear. However, usual galvanic series often used non-fretting condition rationalize corrosion phenomens dissimilar metal close proximity ohmic contact, considerably modified impact mechanical degradation passive film. Moreover, synergistic effect various parameter process significant must recognized, order develop satisfactory explanation overall fretting degradation phenomenon. Sometimes iterative, numerical method necessary modeling combination mechanical- corrosive-degradation, complexity constitutive, non-linear equation often analytical solution [3]. article, adopt strategy combining experimental study model passive state developed describe atomic scale process lead growth breakdown passive film. resulting model optimized experimental data determine value poorly known model parameters. optimized model used predict accumulation damage beyond range optimization.Fretting corrosion one principal topic study orthopedic-implant field [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. worth noting phenomenon also play role accumulation corrosion damage wide range systems, including nuclear power plants, contacting surface often relative motion [12]. present study focused hip implant especially contact Type 316L stainless steel bone cement, modeled poly(methyl methacrylate), PMMA. Hip implant commonly manufactured Type 316L SS, good toughness, strength, corrosion resistance. clinical use, steel stem inserted femoral bone fixed bone cement, consisting principally PMMA. human body, stainless steel immersed physiological solution, high chloride concentration (∼0.2 M) temperature 38 °C. significant difference mechanical property (especially Young's modulus, ratio 100 316L PMMA), stress shielding occurs. physical phenomenon explained following. Metallic material polymer exhibit strain applied stress, thus leading disbonding metal cement. Accordingly, adhesion metal polymer lost short time human gait. debonding involves fretting (friction small displacements, term defined precisely later paper) subsequent friction material contact. Thereafter, material (stainless steel bone cement) subjected small displacement, frictional loading, corrosive environment, resulting fretting corrosion. Consequently, wear occurs bone cement stainless steel; involves debris generation (corrosion products) often produce inflammation reactions, concluding aseptic loosening implant need replacement [5].Passivity breakdown stainless steel topic subjected numerous experimental theoretical studies. paper, author chosen investigate progression damage perspective Point Defect Model (PDM) [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]. worth noting that, order use PDM, value many important physical parameter extracted literature, determined experimentally (oxides layer thickness, instance). Parameter value selected, greatest extent possible, minimize difference may exist experimental condition assumed simulation.Modeling fretting corrosion damage using PDM shown capable accurately predicting wear. principal goal prediction particular ‘W’ wear-shaped area observed fretting corrosion Type 316L SS PMMA [22]. oxide layer thickness current density derived function pH applied potential steady state condition without fretting. Finally, fretting contribution defined, wear depth profile obtained using customized PDM, compared actual wear depth profile observed experimentally. oxide film thickness current density depend strongly local potential, IR potential drop, local pH wear track area. dependency examined, particular, influence wear profile hence development damage. result also discussed term crevice corrosion within friction zone.2.

Point Defect ModelAccording Point Defect Model (PDM), passive film envisaged bi-layer structure comprising point defective, nano-crystalline barrier layer porous outer layer formed hydrolysis cation transmitted barrier layer subsequently precipitated hydroxide, oxyhydroxide, oxide, depending upon local condition [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]. stoichiometric formula barrier layer oxide surface stainless steel represented MOχ/2, without specifying exact defect structure. noted elsewhere [13], [14], barrier layer oxide posse high concentration point defect form vacancy metal oxygen sub-lattices metal interstitials. Processes occurring two interface emphasized, location defect generated and/or annihilated. interface assumed equilibrium hence rate film growth destruction metal/barrier layer (m/bl) barrier layer/outer layer (bl/ol) interfaces, respectively, described term kinetic principles. potential profile across barrier layer envisioned illustrated Fig. 3.Download : Download full-size imageFig. 3.

[13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], appears account repeatedly verified, experimental observation structure property passive film [13], [14]. PDM describes passive film term fundamental chemical reaction physico-electrochemical process metal-passive film-solution interphase. passive film found form bi-layer, structure comprising inner, defective metal oxide layer (primary passive film barrier layer) form directly metal precipitated, outer layer form hydrolysis cation ejected inner layer, previously noted. precipitated outer layer frequently incorporates specie found bulk solution contact metal alloy found alloy itself, barrier layer found contain element present metal substrate specie present environment.The PDM describes growth breakdown passive film term mass charge flux via transport point defect (cation vacancies, cation interstitials, oxygen vacancies) across defect semiconducting barrier layer passive film, point defect (cation oxygen vacancy metal interstitials) generated annihilated reaction barrier layer interfaces, Fig. 1. defect generation annihilation reaction barrier layer boundary [metal/barrier layer (m/bl) interface barrier layer/outer layer (bl/ol) interface], equation describing mass charge flux reaction kinetics derived, including equation rate growth oxide metal m/bl interface rate dissolution barrier layer bl/ol interface. mathematical operation yield set equation steady-state passive current density barrier layer thickness response system large small, time-dependent, applied potential perturbations, used electrochemical studies, including chrono-amperometry [18], electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) [19] cyclic voltammetry (CV) [20]. equations, experimentally measured current responses, including electrochemical impedance spectra, upon model optimized, model parameters, standard rate constants, transfer coefficients, interfacial potential drop may determined.In particular case fretting corrosion Type 316L SS contact PMMA, postulated rate destruction barrier layer bl/ol interface due dissolution, also determined wear, possibly involving oxide debris within gap two surfaces, due direct interaction two surface themselves. particular case, chromium-containing alloys, compact inner layer (barrier layer) adjacent metallic surface thin chromic oxide (defective chromia, Cr2+xO3−y) [19], [34], [35], principal defect metal interstitial (x > 0), oxygen vacancy (y > 0), (x > 0, > 0), metal interstitials commonly identified principal defect [19], [21]. barrier layer wide range chromium-containing iron- nickel-base alloy invariably n-type electronic character specific range applied potential [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], expected defect assignment given above. noted above, outer layer form hydrolysis precipitation iron nickel cation ejected barrier layer form hydroxide, oxyhydroxide, oxide corrosion product also incorporate specie solution via co-precipitation. outer layer generally non-defective commonly contains mixed iron/nickel oxide phase [e.g., (Fe, Ni)2O3] different stoichiometry barrier layer. According report literature, Type 316L SS, specifically, barrier layer comprises chromium oxides, “Cr2O3”, outer layer composed iron oxides, Fe (III) [37]. result presented reference obtained high temperature (first vacuum annealed 1050 °C exposition 720 h, pH 8 temperature 350 °C), probable outer layer ambient temperature pH 8 iron hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, iron oxyhydroxide, FeOOH. bulk chromic oxide commonly p-type electronic character, defective chromic oxide barrier layer chromium-containing alloy invariably n-type, determined Mott-Schottky analysis [19], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], emphasizing great care exercised comparing barrier layer passive bulk oxide, former “living entity” (it continually generated destroyed), latter “dead”, point defect Schottky defect injected oxide reaction occurring interfaces, rather Frenkel defect formed movement ion appropriate sublattice interstitial position. Furthermore, interfacial defect generation/annihilation reaction occur close juxtaposition (i.e., interface separated 1–3 nm) (Fig. 1), resulting defect concentration (typically > 1021 cm−3) order magnitude greater thermally induced bulk oxides. simple calculation show concentration cation site cation sublattice Cr2O3 4.14 × 1022 cm−3. Thus, defect concentration estimated greater 2.4% cation sites; far greater observed bulk chromic oxide. Thus, bulk oxide comparable process determining defect structures. electronic character direct result preponderance metal interstitials and/or oxygen vacancy barrier layer. Thus, −0.5 V(SCE) 0.2 V(SCE), cover passive range, passive film Type 316L SS n-type.3.3.

Thus, solution access deepest zone ‘W’-shaped crevice, solution transport difficult contact center, material close proximity. Moreover, acidification occurs deepest zone result increase conductivity, thereby decreasing solution resistance. center zone le deep, depression pH presumably le severe. order ass veracity conclusion, might possible employ hydrogenated palladium wire [52], oxidized iridium [53], oxidized tungsten [54] pH measurement within wear zone, provided accurate correction IR potential drop crevice tip Luggin probe reference electrode made. Indeed, potential pH sensor vs. reference electrode, vary Nernstian fashion proton activity, hence pH, activity hydrogen metal lattice, case Pd-H sensor, established controlled reaction xPd + H = PdxH, within α + β region Pd-H phase diagram [52]. experiment currently planned.This first attempt use PDM model fretting corrosion wear, involved 7 reaction metal/barrier layer barrier layer/solution interfaces. One might expect chloride ion may participate reaction by, example, inserted reaction mechanisms. Indeed, Reaction (VI) VO+H2O⟶k6OO+2H+, could modified read VO+Cl−nH2O⟶k6ClO+nH2O, done theory passivity breakdown [13], [14]. latter reaction involved current density expression, anion adsorption surface oxygen vacancy lead continuous generation cation vacancy bl/ol interface. cation vacancy transported migration across barrier layer m/bl interface. Ordinarily, cation vacancy annihilated Reaction (I), Fig. 4. However, flux vacancy sufficiently large, Reaction (I) may able annihilate vacancy arriving interface, excess vacancy condensing cation sublattice interface form local void. void cause barrier layer separate substrate metal hence prevents film growing metal via occurrence Reaction (III), Fig. 4. barrier layer continues dissolve barrier layer-solution interface, “cap” vacancy condensate thins eventually rupture mark passivity breakdown event. passivity breakdown mechanism, proposed Point Defect Model [13], [14], result sharp enhancement current density.

ConclusionsThis study focused using PDM interpret predict fretting corrosion (wear) occurring Type 316L stainless steel frictional contact PMMA cyclical displacement loading conditions. Optimization PDM measured wear profile yielded PDM parameter required describe evolution fretting corrosion damage.In case n-conductivity type barrier oxide layer passive film, modeling total wear due corrosion mechanical abrasion produced two important results. First all, pH found decrease contact rim deepest zone within ‘W’ wear-shaped crevice. current flow difficult contact center, close proximity surfaces, due highest contact pressure center. Thus, first sight, might expected corrosion would le intense consequently pH might higher, lower concentration cation undergoing hydrolysis. hand, one might also expect pH decrease deepest zone, decrease could correlated crevice corrosion occur zone, even close juxtaposition steel PPMA surfaces. experimental evidence lower pH release gaseous hydrogen, indicating creviced wear zone become acidic steel surface depassivated corrode active state. second piece evidence come PDM. order fit model, pH required reach negative values, indicating significant acidification. Furthermore, resistance follows gradient. variation physical property (resistance pH) optimized, order achieve good agreement simulated actual 2D wear profiles. conclusion would greatly supported if, example, local measurement pH available. experiment currently planned.AcknowledgementsThe author grateful Research Department, Region Rhône-Alpes, France, granting stay Pennsylvania State University, PA, USA.

SEM microstructure image sample given Figure 2.Figure 2 SEM microstructure image heat-treated samples, (a) AB, (b) S1, (c) S2, (d) S3, (e) S4.Open viewerRelatively low temperature (650°C/S1) heat treatment affect microstructure. seen Figures 1(a) 2(a), melt pool still evident. main reason low heat treatment temperature compared sample's melting point. Heat treatment highly influential AM/316L SS microstructure. temperature 900°C above, as-built microstructure deteriorates, melt pool disappear. Atomic diffusion gain importance high temperature time [30]. result heat treatment 900°C 2 h, subcellular particle dissolve, cellular structure lost. replaced coarse homogeneous grains.In metal sample produced DMLS, laser beam focus powder layer creates melt pool focal point. High-speed solidification event occur laser pass layer, high cooling rate (103–108 K s−1) inside melt pool. result high-temperature gradient different solidification rate formed along melt pools, inhomogeneous crystalline anisotropic microstructure observed melt pool as-built samples.The connection temperature gradient (G), solidification rate (R), supercooling (ΔT), alloy composition critical parameter determine solidification microstructure. condition determine whether solidification microstructure planar, cellular, columnar, equiaxed, dendritic. following formula express necessary state cellular columnar solidification [31-34].(2)Where DL diffusion coefficient, (GL) laser melting temperature gradient, (R) growth rate, (ΔT) solidification undercooling, dendritic formation observed as-built microstructure high-temperature gradient occur production technique DMLS (high GL). contrast, fine cellular columnar microstructure formed.Cr isopleth calculated constant content alloying element shown Figure 3.Figure 3 Isopleth Cr constant alloying element composition thermodynamic equilibrium.Open viewerAccording Thermocalc calculations, solidification step composition used study follows:(3)As seen solidification steps, primary ferrite (BCC_A2 (δ)) formed earlier austenite phase FCC_A1 (γ). Additively produced 316L stainless steel known fully austenitic DMLS as-built state [35]. However, according solidification model made ratio composition alloy study, small amount BCC ferrite phase. XRD analysis result (Figure 4), however, ferrite phase found, determined AM/316L SS sample consisted entirely austenite phase. ferrite phase could detected AB heat-treated sample XRD device cannot measure low content small ferrite particles, claimed study Ciu et al. [36].Figure 4 XRD result samples.Open viewerAs seen Figure 4, 316L sample produced DMLS heat-treated sample wholly composed face-centred cubic (FCC) austenite structure. variation sample axis given representation sample easily separated other. variation sample densities.In Figure 5, result EDX-spot analysis performed as-built cellular microstructure cell boundary interior given (Spectrum 1 show point analysis inside cell, Spectrum 2 offer point analysis cell wall).Figure 5 Cell boundary cell interior EDX analysis result.Open viewerThe EDX analysis show elemental microsegregation as-built cell structure, albeit low amounts, cell wall intracellular space. Ni, Cr, Mo, Si, Mn element increase cell border, Fe decreases.Mo increase grain boundary phenomenon occurs, mainly AM/stainless steels. particular, microsegregation Mo element essential corrosion. chemical fluctuation Mo due slower diffusion due rapid solidification technique (large Mo atom heavy) [37,38]. Although corrosion effect Mo change discussed, Trelewicz et al. stated Mo microsegregation harm corrosion resistance alloy. Additionally, Mo element play essential role forming passive film 316L SS material. change Mo element affect passivation behaviour alloy. seen EDX analysis, heterogeneous distribution element as-built microstructure. may adversely affected corrosion behaviour DMLS/316L SS sample [39,40].Voisin et al. investigated fundamental difference cell wall interior effect heat treatment distribution. study confirm cell wall's high Cr Mo low iron content. temperature exceeds 800°C, sub-grain structure slowly disappear, diffusion separated element observed along cell walls. Elemental diffusion completed cell wall begin disappear temperatures. Cell wall AB structure trap solutes. Thus, cause depletion Cr Mo inside cell. cause change corrosion rate. Even small Cr Mo enrichment cell wall make cell wall resistant corrosion. cell wall difference Cr Mo create micro-galvanic effect cause corrosion [41,42].Heat treatment destroy cellular structure homogenise microstructure. Thus, corrosion resistance material increases.The hardness value sample given Figure 6. wrought 316L hardness value literature added graph comparison.Figure 6 Hardness value as-built heat-treated samples. (Compared wrought counterpart).Open viewerThe highest hardness value obtained as-built structure (215 HV). value close hardness wrought 316L alloy [43]. seen Figure 6, strong relationship heat treatment hardness value. applied heat treatment temperature increases, hardness material decreases. hardness value heat-treated sample (650°C/S1) made lowest temperature close 316L wrought partner (202 HV). microstructure changed much temperature still resembles as-built structure. However, heat treatment higher temperature modifies microstructure considerably.There several reason situation; First, internal stress exist as-built structure material due nature DMLS technique. increase rigidity as-built structure. heat treatments, hardness also decrease stress reduction. addition, due nature technique, as-built structure high dislocation density [44]. heat treatment, dislocation density decreases, material's strength decreases. Moreover, as-built microstructure consists cellular sub-grains. cellular sub-granular microstructure effectively inhibits dislocation motion [45]. Therefore, AB 650°C heat-treated sample show highest hardness value. Higher temperature heat treatment (>900°C/S2 S4) disrupt cellular microstructure transform columnar grains. case, dislocation movement becomes straightforward, hardness material decreases. stated previous study annealing heat treatment AM/316L stainless steel high temperatures, residual stress dislocation decrease, acicular, cellular, dendritic, etc., microstructures microstructure disappear, large austenitic grain formed [46]. result factors, high-temperature heat treatment reduce hardness material.Figure 7 Table 4 show cyclic potentiodynamic polarisation (CPP) curve DMLS/316 L SS sample 3.5% NaCl measured value electrochemical parameters.Figure 7 Cyclic potentiodynamic polarisation curve samples.Open viewerTable 4 Electrochemical property samples.SampleEcorr (Vsce)Icorr (10−7 cm−2)Epit (V)Erep (V)PR (V)S4−0.1572.4440.636−0.1590.793S3−0.1595.1250.601−0.1790.739S2−0.1285.9820.493−0.1980.621S1+0.0796.7350.363−0.2050.284AB−0.0537.1240.200−0.2070.253Open viewerThe S4 sample show lowest current density, seen data. However, highest current density found as-built sample. heat treatment temperature positively affect corrosion resistance 316L SS samples. compatible impedance measurements. addition, enlarged region Figure 7, seen sample show current fluctuation due increasing potential. known metastable pitting. indicates unstable passive film formed sample [47]. Figure 7 show current fluctuation (magnified region images) intense, especially AB, S1, S2 samples. sample subjected high heat treatment temperature show significant current fluctuation (metastable pitting). EPit value examined, determined lowest EPit value AB sample. value increased heat treatment temperature, S4 sample showed highest EPit value. Higher EPit value indicate sample resistant stable pit initiation [48]. case, pitting resistance 316L/SS sample increase heat treatment. Another important indicator PR value, show pitting resistance material. PR value calculated difference EPit ECorr (PR = EPit – ECorr). high PR value indicates stability passive oxide film sample surface [49-51]. seen Table 5, PR value sample heat-treated 1150°C (S4) highest value (0.793 V). heat treatment increase pitting resistance DMLS/316L/SS samples. samples’ repassivation potential (ERep) value shown Table 4. AB sample show lowest ERep value. ERep increase heat treatment (it shift noble values). positive ERep value (progeny) indicates material resistant pit growth [52].Table 5 fitting result obtain EIS results.SampleRs (Ω cm2)Rct (×104 Ω cm2)Q (Y0 × 10−4 (Ω−1 cm−2 Sn))nS45.5302.3353.5450.817S28.4181.4981.7230.773S35.0101.4931.3160.700S16.8011.4572.8610.806AB10.720.8032.4650.792Open viewerIn study, determined ERep value increased effect heat treatment. indicates heat treatment increase material's resistance pitting.Figure 8 show EIS graph SLMed 316 L stainless steel sample 3.5 wt-% NaCl solution heat treatment.Figure 8 EIS data DMLS/316 L SS; (a) Equivalent circuit, (b) Nyquist plots; (c, d) Bode plots.

Rct corresponds charge transfer resistance corrosion process, Q constant phase element (CPE), n represents CPE exponent related degree inhomogeneity surface. Typically, value n electrode 0 1 (in real situation) [53].Nyquist plot predict stability oxide film formed DMLS/316L SS samples. Nyquist plot larger diameter show passive film stable and, therefore, higher resistance corrosion [49]. Nyquist plot composed capacitive arc [54]. words, capacitive arc diameter represents corrosion resistance material solution, assumed corrosion resistance increase diameter increase [55]. Large capacitive semicircular loop form stable film sample surface, increasing resistance pitting corrosion [56]. seen Figure 8, Nyquist plot semicircular. Extrapolation semicircle towards low-frequency region, words, intersection curve Zreal axis, used determine total resistance (Rt) system, electrolyte (Rs) charge transfer resistance (Rct) [50].When semicircle diameter DMLS/316L SS sample examined, seen lowest semicircle diameter as-built sample. addition, semicircular diameter sample increase direct proportion heat treatment temperatures. largest diameter found S4 sample. result indicates S4 sample better corrosion behaviour passivation others.Table 5 show as-built sample lowest Rct value. Rct value increase heat treatment temperature increases. study, S4 sample showed highest Rct value. Generally, Rct inversely related corrosion rate metal [57]. indicates slower charge transfer rate lower dissolution rate solution due higher Rct [58]. case, as-built sample heightened corrosion sensitivity, S4 sample highest corrosion resistance.The phase angle frequency value peak bode-phase angle graph give information corrosion rate. Increasing phase angle shifting frequency lower value indicate increase corrosion resistance. addition, rise impedance value Bode-impedance plot indicates increase resistance corrosion [59-61]. peak examined graph bode-phase angle (Figure 8(c)), seen S4 sample lowest frequency highest phase angle (5 Hz., 72.5°), AB sample lowest phase angle highest frequency (15.8 Hz., 48.5°). heat treatment increase phase angle sample shift peak left (towards lower frequency). impedance-frequency graph, S4 sample highest impedance, AB sample show lowest impedance.Voisin et al. also conducted similar study investigating effect heat treatment AM/316L SS material. sample heat treated 400°C 1200°C, advanced characterisation technique investigated effect heat treatment microstructure, dislocations, tensile properties. study, observed heat treatment similar effect microstructural property materials. However, study investigate effect heat treatment corrosion [41]. Fonda et al. investigated mechanical corrosion property heat treatment condition AM/316L SS material. Although microstructure showed similar property study, found corrosion property study showed opposite property Fonda et al. study, found increasing heat treatment temperature improved corrosion property material [62].PorosityFigure 9 show amount porosity polished surface samples.Figure 9 Variation porosity level samples, (a) as-built, (b) S1, (c) s2, (d) S3, (e) S4.Open viewerAs seen Figure 9, DMLS/316L SS sample consist two type voids: lack fusion (LOF) gas porosity. porosity variant result production parameters. type porosity as-built structure act local crack initiation reduce corrosion properties. highest porosity rate seen as-built sample (0.51%). Porosity also decreased heat treatment condition (S1-0.42%, S2-0.30%, S3-0.27, S4-0.11%). inversely proportional relationship corrosion porosity. known increase amount porosity lead higher corrosion rate since pore preferred corrosion zones.Interestingly, effect heat treatment reduces porosity; shown previous study porosity decrease effect heat treatment parts. probably effect heat treatment process providing homogeneity microstructure [10,63].ConclusionsThis study applied heat treatment 316L SS part produced using DMLS method. effect heat treatment microstructure, mechanical properties, especially corrosion material investigated. result briefly summarised below;•In microstructure analysis, unique microstructure 316L SS observed due nature technique. inhomogeneous crystalline anisotropic microstructure kept melt pool as-built samples. addition, cellular sub-grains observed microstructure. Low-temperature heat treatment (650°C) affect as-built structure much. However, 900°C, as-built microstructure deteriorated, forming new large grains. Heat treatment low temperature (650°C) affect as-built microstructure. case, although material exhibit similar corrosion behaviour as-built, corrosion resistance increases. probable reason removal residual stress as-built structure. addition, chemical change dissolved element AB microstructure reduce material's corrosion resistance. microstructure becomes homogeneous heat treatments, corrosion resistance material increases.

IntroductionIn world, 1.5 million hip prosthesis implanted every year. ageing population, number continue increase. Moreover, roughly 10% total hip arthroplasty (THA) lead surgical reoperation 10–15 year [1]. prevent another intervention, study improvement lifetime duration orthopedic implant relevant.In 1960s, Sir John Charnley chose insert hip prosthesis bone cement (based poly(methyl methacrylate) composition), decrease number femoral stem debonding [2]. case cemented prosthesis (Fig. 1), femoral stem commonly austenitic stainless steel: 316L SS.Download : Download high-res image (519KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1. Total hip joint cemented prosthesis components.Due human activity significant difference mechanical property 316L SS bone cement, debonding two material may occur. phenomenon, due stress shielding, lead friction femoral stem bone cement. Cracks appear bone cement layer progress (Fig. 1). Physiological liquid, carrying metal bone cement debris metal ions, reach bone tissue cause tissue inflammation [3]. Debris disturb osteoblast cell (reconstructive cell bone) activity lead osteolysis (bone destruction) thus prosthesis outplacing [4].Due fretting-corrosion (friction small displacement corrosive medium) femoral stem bone cement, two type debris produced: metallic oxide bone cement particles. Several study show debris size, composition, shape concentration influential debris bioreactivity [5], [6]. Due biocompatibility high resistance corrosion biological environment, material like 316L stainless steel PMMA (bone cement), often implanted. However, inertness material relative: form fine powder material may cause tissue reaction [7]. example Escalas et al. [8] showed material solid form surrounded variable inflammatory infiltrate although material powder form surrounded considerable inflammatory infiltrate.The noticeable parameter cell tissue response debris size. case 316L SS, several range debris size observed vivo [9]: submicron particle 1–5 μm irregular particle frequent 5–25 μm particle rarely observed. Wilbert et al. found 77% 316L SS particle le 1.2 μm, 17% 1.2 1.7 μm 6% 1.7 2.1 μm [10].In case PMMA debris, microscopic submicroscopic particle also observed vivo. cemented prostheses, PMMA abundant material found surrounding tissue [6]. wide range size observed recovered human tissues. smallest particle le 1 μm even submicroscopic, probably inferior 0.1 μm [11]. Sharp particle 1 5 μm commonly observed. Spherical particle 5 25 μm, 20 200 μm ‘beads pit cracks’ ‘irregular chunks’ 1 mm also observed [9].Particles shape play role tissue response. Small metal particle ‘globular’ ‘irregularly shaped’ larger particle ‘sharp-edged’ ‘spiked’. PMMA particle commonly ‘globular’, ‘spherical’ ‘fragmented’. Globular particle pre-polymerized one fragmented particle result micro-displacements implant bone cement bone cement bone [9].The principal consequence presence particle increase contact surface implant material physiological fluid, particle phagocytosis particle transport lymph nodes, lung spleen [6]. Fretting-corrosion one principal cause debris generation thus hip prosthesis loosening. fretting-corrosion study carried out. case, fretting-corrosion phenomenon femoral stem bone cement modeled fretting-corrosion 316L SS sample PMMA, mechanical property bone cement.Because complex composition (numerous salt proteins) physiological liquid, work focus 1:1 solution, i.e. solution constituted NaCl. influence ionic strength, I, defined by(1)I=12∑izi2Ciwhere zi: ion charge Ci: ion concentration investigated.In previous work [12], [13], several ionic strength studied: NaCl solution, concentration 10-3, 10-2, 10-1 1 mol L-1, also Ringer solution.Some author shown key-role albumin [14], [15]. Valero Vidal et al. [15] show albumin modify open circuit potential (OCP) behavior act anodic inhibitor 316L. fretting-corrosion test Ti–6Al–4V alloy alumina, Hiromoto Mischler [16] show albumin affect wear volume [16].During fretting-corrosion test, total material loss, W, sum material loss due mechanical wear obtained without influence corrosion, Wm, plus material loss due corrosion obtained without fretting action, Wc. synergistic effect corrosion mechanical wear. synergy term, ΔW, mean corrosion increase wear due mechanics, ΔWcm, mechanic increase wear due corrosion, ΔWmc [17], [18]. relation total material loss different contribution wear thus given by(2)W=Wm+Wc+ΔW=Wm+Wc+(ΔWcm+ΔWmc)Fretting-corrosion test investigated two electrochemical conditions. close possible vivo conditions, test investigated OCP conditions. information corrosion current obtained electrochemical condition. why, fretting-corrosion test also investigated applied potential, E=−400 mV (SCE). value close OCP value fretting threshold potential anodic cathodic transition current [12], [13].The aim work observe determine influence ionic strength albumin cathodic applied potential (E=−400 mV (SCE)) corrosion current, wear volume synergy also, thanks atomic force microscopic (AFM) images, size, shape quantity debris.

IntroductionThe medical grade 316L stainless steel (SS) implant commonly used orthopaedics dental implant applications, 316L SS metallic implant exhibit superior biocompatibility, corrosion resistance, nonmagnetic response mechanical property (Nagarajan et al., 2012, Sivaraj Vijayalakshmi, 2018a, Sivaraj Vijayalakshmi, 2018b). Moreover, cost implant low compared metallic implant magnesium alloy, Ti6Al4V etc. spite these, major drawback 316L SS implant ion release surface due presence Ni, Cr, Fe may lead implant failure (Xia et al., 2018, Hubadillah et al., 2020). Hence, prevent ion release surface implant enhance biological property, bioactive ceramic material hydroxyapatite (HA), tricalcium phosphate, bioglass, carbon-silicon used. HA extensively used bone substitute crystal structure, biocompatible osteoconductive nature (Erdem et al., 2020). HA club easily bioactive material physiochemical environment due similar stoichiometric ratio bone, lower crystallinity solubility. Additionally, HA non-toxic produce minimal immunological reactions, vitro attachment. Also, nanosized hydroxyapatite crack free scaffold promotes rapid cell proliferation, spreading, rapid bioabsorption bone regeneration short time (Ige et al., 2012). However, low antibacterial activity, facture toughness, weak physiochemical property, brittleness, wear resistance high degradation rate HA decrease implant life time. drawback rectified modifying implant surface binary material high physicochemical property formed ceramics, polymer graphene based material.Materials carbon nanotubes, alumina, polymer yttria-stabilized zirconia often added improve mechanical, biological chemical property bioactive hydroxyapatite matrix metallic implant (Zhang et al., 2013). Among materials, functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotube (f-MWCNT) inspired increasing attention due remarkable property like high resilience, high aspect ratio biocompatibility (Liu et al., 2018). Also, f-MWCNT attracted attention many field including biosensing, drug delivery, biological scaffold biological imaging, due excellent mechanical properties, thermal stability ultrahigh surface area 1587 m2/g (Al-Namshah Mohamed, 2020). Specifically, f-MWCNT exhibit high cytotoxicity human pathogen Bacillus subtilis (B.subtilis), Escherichia coli (E. coli), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) Streptococcus mutans (S.mutans) physical contact, reactive oxygen specie (ROS) oxidative stress (Li et al., 2017). Moreover, smaller diameter f-MWCNT increase osteoblast cell adhesion implant surface support kill pathogens. f-MWCNT’s could trigger activation multiple reactive mechanism contact blood. Due bio inertness, f-MWCNT elicit immune response site regeneration (Zhu et al., 2017, Mohammadinezhad et al., 2018). Hence, coating f-MWCNT HA/316L SS implant surface made present study, could induce potential biological corrosion resistance characteristic related single phase bioactive material (Gopi et al., 2014). Xu et al. (2009) reported CNT reinforced HA show beneficial effect osteoblast cell proliferation. Balani et al. (2007) confirmed CNT played significant role reinforcement providing toughness strength brittle hydroxyapatite bio ceramics. Mainly, f-MWCNT reinforced HA coating show improved antibacterial anticorrosive efficiency higher pure HA (Xia et al., 2018). spite these, modification 316L SS implant HA/f-MWCNT give better result biomedical application low tensile strength fracture toughness HA result lower biological response calcium orthophosphates.To overcome this, tried synthesis nanosized trinary composite, increase hydrogen bonding, would stimul physiological activity cells. that, essential element Mg2+, Sr2+, Cu2+, Ag+, K+ Cl−, F− may substituted HA/f-MWCNT may lead obtain desired property implant orthopaedic dental application (Bracci et al., 2009, Yang et al., 2010, Bir et al., 2012, Sivaraj Vijayalakshmi, 2018a, Sivaraj Vijayalakshmi, 2018b). Among elements, studied Cu substitution HA/f-MWCNT exhibit superior advantage due possibility incorporating key ion structure hydroxyapatite, endowing Cu-HA nanoparticles specific biological features. Cu important trace element mammalian life enhance activity various enzyme play vital role crosslinking collagen elastin bone (Li et al., 2020). Recent study showed copper-hydroxyapatite exhibit improved antibacterial activity pure hydroxyapatite blocking protein functional groups, inactivation enzyme creation free radical membrane bound Cu destruct normal membrane integrity. Stanić et al. (2010); Huang et al., 2015a, Huang et al., 2015b) reported bacterial inactivation Cu2+ substituted HA prepared different techniques, incorporated material found provide higher antibacterial activity Staphylococcus aureus (S.aureus) Escherichia coli (E.coli).
