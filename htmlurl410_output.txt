IntroductionMartensitic stainless steel commonly used turbine (steam turbine & hydraulic turbine) blades, valves, bearings, pressure vessels, cutting tool manufacturing components, superior mechanical performance resistance corrosion, operating condition either high low temperature. mechanical metallurgical property alloy changed heat treatments. steel suitable wide range application steam generators, pressure vessels, cutting tools, offshore platform oil extraction [1], [2]. property welded joint generally depends upon weld joint design, welding parameters, filler material, welding process used, shielding medium skill welder. Several study welded joint stainless steel reported groove design, heat input post weld heat treatment significant effect joint performance. Variation groove angle also affect performance welded joints. study, found groove angle increased 0˚ 120˚, penetration depth decreased heat dissipates quickly edge groove thus leading increased tendency full penetration certain problem overheating, grain coarsening structure filling. concluded angle groove fulfill complete penetration groove weld, smaller found better [3], [4], [5].In addition different type heat treatment viz., tempering, quenching annealing effect performance martensitic stainless steel. segregation particle coming solute second phase particle matrix also contribute higher strength ductility weld metal grain boundary area due much segregation solute atom restrict motion dislocations, consequently increase mechanical property weld metal. amount carbide depends temperature, quenching process common phase lath martensite microstructure martensitic stainless steel. presence carbide decreased increasing austinizing temperature i.e., 980 °C 1050 °C resulted maximum hardness, toughness strength [6], [7], [8]. Filler material selection localized post weld heat treatment also affect performance welds. Formation control M23C6 carbide depends heat treatment cooling rate, amount M23C6 (precipitated carbides) increase increasing cooling rate. Furthermore, surface property (micro-hardness) AISI 410SS improved using laser surface re-melting technique [9], [10]. cooling rate affect martensite start temperature decrease increasing cooling rate, greater deformation prior austenite cause mechanical stabilisation austenite lead difficulty martensite lath propagation austenite [11], [12]. mechanical behavior metallurgical performance matrensitic stainless steel also depends welding process used post weld heat treatment [13], [14], [15].However, experimental work weld groove volume welded joint reported influence groove volume weld joint performance Martensitic AISI 410 stainless steel studied. Since groove volume affect heat input/heat dissipation characteristic weld, seems worthwhile investigate establish effective volume would improve mechanical performance joints. bridge important research gap, focus present experimental work analyze effect different weld groove volume mechanical (tensile impact toughness) metallurgical (microstructure microhardness) performance welds.2.

Results discussion3.1. Mechanical performance3.1.1. Tensile strength weldsTransverse tensile testing carried per ASTM E08 standard weld joint three different groove volume received condition well post weld heat treated condition evaluate ultimate tensile strength, percentage elongation location fracture [19]. result tensile testing presented Table 7. observed result transverse tensile testing location fracture specimen base metal indicates weld zone case joint stronger base metal, thus resulting joint efficiency 100%. welded condition, maximum UTS value 774.05 MPa possessed welded joint WJGV-1P subjected post weld heat treatment minimum UTS value 677.49 MPa possessed welded joint WJGV-3. maximum percentage elongation 11.16% possessed joint WJGV-1in welded condition whereas minimum percentage elongation 5.17% possessed welded joint WJGV-3Pwhen subjected PWHT. main trend indicated joint PWHT used present case improves tensile performance joints. However strength increase occurs expense reduced ductility. main reason trend followed joint that, firstly corresponding joint WJGV-1, since groove volume relatively less, welding arc heat dissipates relatively faster rate, thus resulting fine grained microstructure weld zone increase overall stress carrying capacity joint. Further, PWHT joint induces tempering effect weld zone due tempered martensite formation improves tensile strength, overall ductility joint decrease hardening effect induced joint [7]. specimen tensile testing photographed shown Fig. 4.Table 7.

Almost nearly similar trend followed specimen also i.e. PWHT could increase Charpy impact energy joint marginal extent. different section fractured impact specimen impact toughness testing shown Fig. 5. main reason could attributed result since joint welded using variable groove volume, variable thermal cycle experienced joint solidifying welding, result microstructural variation across different zone weldments. instance joint WJGV-1 solidifies experiencing relatively faster cooling rate, thus giving rise fine grained microstructure weld zone relatively lesser grain coarsening HAZ [6], [8]. subjected PWHT zone undergo microstructural change CVN value marginally improved. study establishes using smaller groove volume beneficial achieving good impact strength joints.Table 8.

Microstructural studiesThe specimen polished microstructural examination welded joint standard procedure, etching done using vilella’s regent [21]. Based microstructural examination, first general observation made micrographs weld zone corresponding WJGV-1 joint relatively finer (i.e. small dendrite small inter-dendritic spacing) compared WJGV-3 joint. may attributed fact since relatively lesser amount weld metal deposited smaller groove volume due thermal gradient established across weldment steeper, thus making cooling rate joint faster, consequently result fine microstructures [16]. observed larger groove volume weld metal required fill weld groove, heat dissipation slow rate due cooling rate weld zone relatively slower, consequently result relatively coarse microstructure [1]. Furthermore observed post weld heat treatment also induces significant microstructural change weld metal. instance PWHT inducing tempering effect result formation carbide due matrix get depleted/deficient stiffener like carbon chromium, main reason overall reduction microhardness value weld zone joints[10], [12].
